[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a pro action handler that automatically registers the most recently used emojis. 

## Pro action handler

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] replaces the ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler`` with a `ProKeyboardActionHandler` that automatically registers emojis as you use them. 

This will automatically populate the "most recent" emojis category, which is shown in the emoji keyboard.
