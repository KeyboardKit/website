Keyboards sometimes have to open urls, trigger deeplinks or navigate from the keyboard to the main app. This is however hard, since keyboard extensions can't use `UIApplication.main`.

KeyboardKit therefore has a ``KeyboardUrlOpener`` that can open any URLs from a keyboard extension, without using `UIApplication`.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a `PreviousAppNavigator` that can navigate back to the previously opened app, e.g. after dictation. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## How to open URLs from the keyboard extension

The ``KeyboardUrlOpener`` class can be used to open any URL from a keyboard without having to use `UIApplication`**`.

The class has a ``KeyboardUrlOpener/shared`` instance that can be used from anywhere:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://keyboardkit.com")
try? KeyboardUrlOpener.shared.open(url)
```

This is for instance used by the KeyboardKit Pro dictation engine, to navigate from the keyboard to the main app to start dictation.



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a `PreviousAppNavigator` that can be used to navigate back to the previous app, e.g. after dictation.

This is a protocol, so any type can implement it:

```swift
struct ContentView: View, PreviousAppNavigatorÂ {

    var body: some View {
        Button("Go back") {
            do {
                try navigateBackToPreviousApp()
            } catch {
                print(error)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is used by the Pro dictation engine, to navigate from the main app back to the keyboard.

> Warning: As of iOS 17, the PreviousAppNavigator doesn't work anymore. Make sure to adjust your UI accordingly, until it's replaced by a working solution.
