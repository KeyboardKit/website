Say hello to [Type Devanagari]({{page.appstore}}) - a Sanskrit keyboard, developed by indie dev [@NatashaTheRobot]({{page.twitter}}).

[Type Devanagari]({{page.appstore}}) is a Sanskrit keyboard, build by [@NatashaTheRobot]({{page.twitter}}) with KeyboardKit.

After starting to learn Sanskrit many years ago, Natasha was surprised to find that the only Sanskrit language keyboard available on iPhone / iPad was the built-in one.

The built-in keyboard was very difficult to use and required a whole new system to learn for typing. 

> No matter how much I used it, it never became easy, fast, or natural. It became impossible to look up Sanskrit words on the go on mobile, as typing each word took such a long time.

This is when Natasha got the idea to build a Sanskrit keyboard, using a standard English keyboard layout, with a few extra characters inspired by the IAST roman script for Devanagari.

> KeyboardKit made it very simple and quick to actually make it! Thank you.

Stories like these are so inspiring! Creating a custom keyboard shouldn't have to be hard or take a long time. It's wonderful to hear that Natasha enjoyed using KeyboardKit to build her app.
