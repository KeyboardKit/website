Say hi to [JustType]({{page.appstore}}) - an AI-powered iOS keyboard, developed by indie developer Thomas Burkhardt.

![JustType header]({{page.image}})

[JustType]({{page.appstore}}) is an AI-powered keyboard built by Thomas Burkhardt using KeyboardKit Pro, that aims to let you type efficiently and accurately on the iPhone.

Since his BlackBerry days, Thomas has struggled with typing efficiently & accurately on the iPhone, where auto-correct often led to embarrassing mistakes. When ChatGPT emerged, Thomas used it to proofread emails, but found that copying and pasting text messages on his iPhone was inefficient. 

In early 2024, while attending a Spanish language school in Mexico, Thomas frequently texted in Spanish, which definitely needed AI corrections. Most AI keyboard apps he tried were clunky and too expensive, even though ChatGPT API is affordable.
 
> This inspired me to create JustType as a home project — an AI-powered keyboard app that corrects typos, grammar, translations, and mood adjustments with a single click. 

For Spanish texts, Thomas didn't just want corrections; he just wanted to learn from his mistakes by receiving feedback as he typed. Additionally, he wanted to build something highly customizable that even allowed you to create your own ChatGPT prompts.
 
As a software engineer without prior experience in Swift or mobile app development, Thomas was surprised by how closed the iOS system keyboard was. That’s when he discovered KeyboardKit. 

> KeyboardKit's feature-rich capabilities and extensive documentation provided me with a viable alternative. What made the biggest difference was the demo app, which provided clear, hands-on examples of key features, making it easy for a Swift newbie like myself to get started.
 
Encouraged by friends and family, Thomas decided to create a commercial version of JustType. To achieve this, he needed additional keyboard languages, enhanced autocorrect, and other advanced features offered by KeyboardKit Pro. 

> Daniel, the creator of KeyboardKit, was incredibly supportive and responsive, even accommodating special requests when I purchased the Gold License.
