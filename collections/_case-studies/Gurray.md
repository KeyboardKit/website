Say hello to [Gurray]({{page.appstore}}) - a keyboard for indigenous communication, developed by Australian [Anomaly Software]({{page.anomaly}}) for the WCC Language Program.

The [WCC Language Program]({{page.wcclp}}) works with and supports First Nation's Language Groups to develop, document, and promote physical/digital language learning resources.

WCC LP approached Anomaly with a vision of using cutting-edge technologies like computer vision to build delightful educational and communication experiences.

Anomaly built Gurray, which is the world's first language keyboard app that empowers its users to infuse their digital conversations with a rich array of Indigenous language. 

Derived from the Wiradjuri word meaning "change or refreshment"*, Gurray transforms the way we integrate Indigenous languages into our digital conversations.

With Gurray, just type your thoughts in English. As you type, Gurray intelligently shows contextually relevant words in your chosen Indigenous language and lets you apply them with a quick tap.

Gurray was built to match native iOS and Android keyboard standards, and uses KeyboardKit for the iOS keyboard. It's free and integrates support for the WCC LP countries and communities.

Enabling communication between people is a key focus for KeyboardKit, so it's amazing to see Gurray launch with focus on indigenous communication among the Australian communities.

You can download Gurray from the [App Store]({{page.appstore}}) and read more about the WWDC LP [here]({{page.portfolio}})!
