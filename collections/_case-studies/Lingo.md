## Implementing the Keyboard

Lingo uses KeyboardKit Pro to implement the main keyboard and to power many of its features.

> With KeyboardKit, creating Lingo’s custom keyboard extension felt like magic. It’s incredibly easy to implement, fully customizable, and removes the complexity of building robust keyboard experiences. KeyboardKit handles the heavy lifting, letting you focus on the fun part. - Stefan Liesendal, Lingo

Lingo is one of those apps that make you truly happy to use. The onboarding is a true first class experience, and all aspects of the app are tastefully designed.

> "Building keyboard extensions with KeyboardKit is not just easy; It’s genuinely enjoyable!“  - Stefan Liesendal
