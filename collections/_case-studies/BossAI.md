## What is BossAI?

[BossAI]({{page.website}}) is a voice-first AI keyboard with two powerful modes that work in every app with a text field - Mail, Slack, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, code editors, and more.

**Dictation** lets you speak naturally and get polished, context-aware text back. BossAI removes filler words, fixes grammar, and matches tone to the app you're in. Type at 180 wpm without editing.

**Boss Mode** takes it further. Speak a command, and BossAI reads your screen, understands context, and writes the response. No screenshots. No hassle. Just switch to the BossAI keyboard and speak.


## The Story Behind BossAI

[Hyathi Technologies]({{page.developer-url}}) has spent years building AI and cybersecurity products for global clients. The team shipped AI daily. But internally, they found their hours burned by typing, not thinking.

To Hyathi, the best ideas came in motion. Walking meetings, calls on the go, thoughts in-commute. But typing them out? Half those thoughts vanished.

> Native dictation only gave us word salad. AI chatbots required copy-pasting between apps. Nothing understood context. Nothing knew whether you were emailing a client or texting a friend.

The shift happened with one question: What if AI didn't just hear your words - but understood what you were trying to do? Not transcription. Comprehension. One voice command. Done.

That became Boss Mode. BossAI has now shipped on three platforms, with the goal to challenge the keyboard's 155-year monopoly on human-computer communication.


## Implementing the Keyboard

Building a custom keyboard that works universally across every app - with the complexity of native layouts, gesture handling, autocomplete, and multi-locale support - could have consumed months of implementation. Instead, the team turned to KeyboardKit.

> KeyboardKit gave us a production-ready keyboard engine with native layouts, gesture handling, autocomplete, multi-locale, etc., to let us focus entirely on the AI layer that makes BossAI unique.

Rather than reinventing keyboard fundamentals, KeyboardKit provided an infrastructure to support BossAI's unique voice-first features.

> Clean architecture, solid documentation, and Daniel's responsiveness made it straightforward to build on top of KeyboardKit. Without it, the product would have taken significantly longer to ship.

The Hyathi team could dedicate their expertise to what makes BossAI different, and add that on top of the keyboard engine. [BossAI]({{page.website}}) is now live on the App Store.
