title: Text Input
---

Keyboard extensions will by default *only* send text to the text field in the currently active app, and will not detect if you select a text field within the keyboard.

This makes it hard to build features that require the user to type within the keyboard extensions, like search features, or AI-based text inputs.

KeyboardKit therefore adds ways to make this easier, and adds ways to route text to any other text field within the keyboard extension.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks even more [input utilities](#pro), like a ``KeyboardTextField`` that automatically lets you type within a keyboard extension.



## Text Input 

KeyboardKit has ways to make text routing easier. For instance, ``KeyboardContext``'s ``textInputProxy`` can be set to route text to any other text field or custom proxy.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks text input views that automatically register and unregister themselves as the `textInputProxy` when they receive and lose focus.

These views support SwiftUI `FocusState` and have a `focused` view modifier that lets you provide a custom done button that slides in when the view is focused.
