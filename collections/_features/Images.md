KeyboardKit provides keyboard-specific images that make it easy to mimics a native keyboard style.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] provides vectorized assets for ``EmojiCategory``, which are used in the keyboard.


## Core Features

KeyboardKit has `Image` extensions that resolve to SF Symbols, like `.keyboard`, `.keyboardBackspace`, `.keyboardDismiss`, etc.

KeyboardKit also has a few `Image` extensions that resolve to custom assets, like `.keyboardEmoji`. 

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks even more emoji-related image assets, like `.emojiCategory(.frequent)`, `.emojiCategory(.smileys)`, etc.

Since these asset-based images are vectorized PDF assets, they scale well when they are resized.
