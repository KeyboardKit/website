The KeyboardKit Pro Enterprise Plan includes software escrow services, which provide an additional layer of security and continuity for software that relies on KeyboardKit Pro.



## What is Software Escrow?

Software escrow is a critical insurance policy for businesses that depend on closed-source software. 

With a proper software escrow agreement in place, businesses can access the closed source code, documentation, and build instructions if the licensor faces critical events such as bankruptcy. This access allows them to use the source code to ensure their products remain operational.

Many enterprises require escrow agreements for critical software partnerships, and recognize them as a safeguard in today's digital business environment. We are therefore happy to include this in the [Enterprise Tier](/pro), to keep our enterprise customers safe.


## KeyboardKit Pro Software Escrow Services

KeyboardKit recognizes that businesses that choose KeyboardKit Pro make a strategic decision that deserves proper protection. Our software escrow agreement guarantees that you will be able to get access to the closed source code if the KeyboardKit owner company goes out of business.

If this would happen, you will be able to request access to the KeyboardKit Pro source from a third party, and use it to keep your product operational. The source code can be added to your product as a local or self-hosted Swift Package, and requires no integration changes.
