KeyboardKit Pro offers software escrow services to enterprise customers. This means that you will be able to access the KeyboardKit Pro source code in case KeyboardKit goes out of business.

## What is Software Escrow?

Software escrow services act as a critical insurance policy for businesses that rely on closed-source software. With a proper escrow service agreement in place, businesses will be able to access source code, documentation, and build instructions, in case the licensor faces business-critical events.

For large-scale applications, this level of protection isn't just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's a critical component of responsible business continuity planning. Software escrow provides risk management that helps satisfy both internal security requirements and external compliance standards. 

Many enterprises require escrow agreements for significant software partnerships, and recognizes them as a safeguard in today's digital business environment. KeyboardKit Pro is happy to now offer these services as part of the [Enterprise Tier](/pro), to keep our enterprise customers safe.
