KeyboardKit supports [{{site.locales.count}} locales](/locales):

{{ site.locales.flags }}

Each supported language has keyboard-specific information and capabilities, and localized strings that can be translated with the ``KKL10n`` enum.

KeyboardKit supports LTR (Left-To-Right) and RTL locales. You don't need to do anything to support RTL. Just change the locale and KeyboardKit will automatically adjusts the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks localized callouts and layout services for every locale in your license. This lets you generate a fully localized keyboard with no additional code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks additional diacritics and input engines for languages like Vietnamese.
