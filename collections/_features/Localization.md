KeyboardKit supports [{{site.locales.count}} locales](/locales):

{{ site.locales.flags }}

Each supported language has keyboard-specific information and capabilities, and localized strings that can be translated with the ``KKL10n`` enum.

KeyboardKit supports LTR (Left-To-Right) and RTL locales. You don't need to do anything to support RTL. Just change the locale and KeyboardKit will automatically adjusts the keyboard.

KeyboardKit extends Foundation ``Locale`` with keyboard-specific views, that can be used to perform locale-specific operations, pick locales, etc.
