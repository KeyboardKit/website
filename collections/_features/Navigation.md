Keyboard extensions may sometimes have to open a URL or trigger a deep link, for instance to the main app or System Settings.

Since Keyboard extensions can't use `UIApplication.shared`, KeyboardKit has other alternate ways to open URLs and trigger deep links.


## How to open URLs from a keyboard extension

One way to open a URL from a keyboard, is to use the ``KeyboardInputViewController``'s ``openUrl(_:)``.

Another way is to trigger a ``url(_:id:)`` action and let the ``KeyboardActionHandler`` in ``services`` handle it. This lets us avoid having to depend on the controller, which can lead to memory leaks.


## How to open System Settings

KeyboardKit defines a ``.systemSettings`` URL that can be used to open your app in System Settings.

If your keyboard randomly navigates to the System Settings root instead of your app, try to add an empty settings bundle to your app.
