KeyboardKit makes it easy to integrate with the system clipboard, where the user can paste directly from the system pasteboard, or from a list of custom clips.

You can use the `pasteFromClipboard` action to trigger a paste operation, or use the various screens and views in KeyboardKit Pro for more control.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``Clipboard.SettingsScreen`` that can be used to manage clips in the main app, a `Clipboard.Keyboard` that can be used to paste from the keyboard, etc.:

<div class="grid col2">
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}clipboard-settingsscreen.jpg" /></span>
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}clipboard-keyboard.jpg" /></span>
</div>
