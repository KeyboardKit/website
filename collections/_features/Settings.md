Great keyboard apps use the main app to onboard the user and to show the state of the keyboard, for instance if the keyboard is enabled, if Full Access is enabled, etc.

KeyboardKit adds ways to make this easier and lets you use App Groups to automatically sync data and settings between the main app and its keyboard.

The various namespaces provide their own settings classes, such as `Autocomplete.Settings`. These classes provide auto-persisted properties, that automatically sync between the app and keyboard.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks screen templates that can be used by the main app or within a keyboard:

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img alt="A Home Screen" src="{{page.assets}}app-homescreen.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="A Settings Screen" src="{{page.assets}}keyboard-settingsscreen.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="A Locale Screen" src="{{page.assets}}autocomplete-settingsscreen.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="A Locale Screen" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardtheme-settingsscreen.jpg" /></div>
</div>

These screens can be added with a single line of code. Each screen can be customized and localized.
