While iOS has very limited ways to customize the look and feel of the native keyboard, KeyboardKit can be styled and customized to great extent, using styles and themes.

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardStyle`` namespace that contains style-related types and views, as well as a ``KeyboardStyleService`` that can provide dynamic styles for different parts of a keyboard.


## Colors & Images 

KeyboardKit defines keyboard-specific ``Color`` and ``Image`` assets that can be used in any keyboard.

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img alt="Image Extensions" src="{{page.assets}}styling-images.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="Color Extensions" src="{{page.assets}}styling-colors.jpg" /></div>
</div>


See the docs for info on how semi-transparent colors are used to work around a [system bug][Bug] in iOS.

## Type Extensions

Many KeyboardKit types define standard images, texts & colors. For instance:

```swift
let context = KeyboardContext()
let image = KeyboardAction.command.standardButtonImage(for: context) // Command icon
let text = KeyboardAction.space.standardButtonText(for: context)     // KKL10n.space
```


## Style Modifiers

Most KeyboardKit views have custom styles and style modifiers. For instance, the ``Keyboard.Button`` view has a ``Keyboard.ButtonStyle`` that can be applied with the ``.keyboardButtonStyle(_:)`` modifier.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional image assets, and a ``KeyboardTheme`` engine that makes easier to style keyboards with themes.


### Emoji Icons

KeyboardKit Pro emoji-specific, vectorized assets, like the ``.keyboardEmoji`` and ``.emojiCategory(_:)``:

<img alt="Emoji Images" src="{{page.assets}}images-emojis.jpg" />

### Themes

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``KeyboardTheme`` engine that makes easier to style keyboards with themes:

<div class="grid col3">
    <div><img alt="Standard Green Theme" src="{{site.assets}}/themes/standard-green.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="Swifty Blue Theme" src="{{site.assets}}/themes/swifty-blue.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="Cotton Candy Theme" src="{{site.assets}}/themes/candyshop-cottoncandy.jpg" /></div>
</div>
