description: KeyboardKit lets you style your keyboards to great extent.
---

While native iOS keyboards provide very little ways of customizing the look and feel of the keyboard, KeyboardKit-based keyboards can be styled and customized to great extent.

KeyboardKit uses ``KeyboardStyle`` types to style its views. For instance, a ``KeyboardStyle/InputCallout`` style can be used to style a ``Callouts/InputCallout`` view.

KeyboardKit will bind a ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` instance to ``.services`` when the keyboard is loaded. You can modify or replace this provider at any time. 

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a powerful theme engine and a bunch of themes. More information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Terminology

KeyboardKit uses different names for different ways to style keyboards. 

* A ``KeyboardStyle`` style is *static* and can be applied to certain views.
* A ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` is a *dynamic* style provider that provides context-based styles.
* A `KeyboardTheme` (Pro) is a *static* style provider that can define, reuse and share styles.

You can mix and match these different concepts as you see fit.



## Resources & Assets

KeyboardKit comes with colors and assets that can be used to create native-looking keyboards.

* `Image` has a bunch of keyboard-specific images, e.g. `.keyboardBackspace`.
* `Color` has a bunch of keyboard-specific colors, e.g. `.standardButtonBackground`.
* ``KeyboardAction`` and other types have standard images, texts and colors.

For instance, to get the standard button image and text for an action, you can do this:

```swift
let context = KeyboardContext()
let image = KeyboardAction.command.standardButtonImage(for: context) // Command icon
let text = KeyboardAction.space.standardButtonText(for: context)     // Localized "space"
```

Have a look at <doc:Understanding-Colors> and <doc:Understanding-Images> for more information about colors and images.



## Styling namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Styling`` namespace that contains styling-related types.

The namespace doesn't contain protocols, open classes or types that are meant to be top-level ones. It's meant to contain types used by top-level types, to make the library easier to overview.



## Keyboard appearance

A keyboard appearance determines whether or not the keyboard will be light or dark. It's not the same as a *color scheme*, which means that a keyboard can be dark(er) while still in light mode.

KeyboardKit has a ``Styling/KeyboardAppearanceViewModifier`` that can be used to apply a keyboard appearance to a view:

```
TextField("Enter text", text: $text)
    .keyboardAppearance(.dark)
```

Note that applying a dark appearances will make iOS tell the extension that the *color scheme* is dark, while this may in fact not be true. 



## Keyboard styles

The ``KeyboardStyle`` namespace contains many keyboard styles, like ``KeyboardStyle/Button``, ``KeyboardStyle/Callout`` and ``KeyboardStyle/EmojiKeyboard``.

All styles can be modified, including most standard values. For instance, here we apply a red background to the standard ``KeyboardStyle/Callout`` style:

```swift
var style = KeyboardStyle.Callout.standard
style.backgroundColor = .red
KeyboardStyle.Callout.standard = style
```

Most styles have a **.standard** style that you can use as a template. The standard styles can also be overwritten with a custom style to change the global default style of that component.



## Keyboard button styles

Most view that support styling let you pass in a style in their initializer. For instance, here we apply a custom autocomplete toolbar style that makes the item title font bold:

```swift
var style = KeyboardStyle.AutocompleteToolbar.standard
style.item.titleFont = .body.weight(.bold)

let bar = AutocompleteToolbar(
    suggestions: [],
    style: style
)
```

The ``KeyboardStyle/Button`` is different from most other styles, since it can style any view to look like a keyboard button, using the `.keyboardButtonStyle(...)` view modifier. 

The ``KeyboardStyle/Button`` style also doesn't have a **.standard** style, since the style of a keyboard button depends on so many factors, such as button type, device type, keyboard appearance, color scheme, etc.

You can use a ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` to create dynamic button styles. Views like the ``SystemKeyboard`` use a style provider to get a button style for each keyboard button, based on the button action, current device, etc. 



## Style providers

A ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` can return dynamic styles for different parts of the keyboard. Unlike static styles, style providers can vary styles depending on the ``KeyboardContext``, ``KeyboardAction`` etc.

KeyboardKit will bind a ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` instance to ``.services`` when the keyboard is loaded. You can modify or replace this provider at any time.



## How to create a custom style provider

You can create a custom style provider by inheriting ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` and customize the parts you want, or implement the ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` protocol from scratch.

For instance, here's a custom provider that inherits ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider`` and makes all input buttons red:

```swift
class CustomKeyboardStyleProvider: StandardKeyboardStyleProvider {
    
    override func buttonStyle(
        for action: KeyboardAction,
        isPressed: Bool
    ) -> KeyboardStyle.Button {
        let style = super.buttonStyle(for: action, isPressed: isPressed)
        if !action.isInputActionÂ { return style }
        style.backgroundColor = .red
        return style
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just set the ``.services`` provider to this custom one:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        keyboardStyleProvider = CustomKeyboardStyleProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a theme engine that makes it a lot easier to define styles for a keyboard.

### Themes

A `KeyboardTheme` can be used to define a bunch of styles, such as button and background styles. You can also use other themes as templates to create your own custom themes. 

KeyboardKit comes with many pre-defined themes:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard
KeyboardTheme.swifty
KeyboardTheme.minimal
KeyboardTheme.candyShop
KeyboardTheme.colorful
KeyboardTheme.neon
KeyboardTheme.tron
```

All pre-defined themes come with style variations that allow you to tweak parts of a theme:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard(.pink)
KeyboardTheme.swifty(.blue)
KeyboardTheme.minimal(.midnight)
KeyboardTheme.candyShop(.cottonCandy)
KeyboardTheme.colorful(.purple)
KeyboardTheme.neon(.night)
KeyboardTheme.tron(.sark)
```

You can also define a custom style variation directly in the theme initializer:

```swift
KeyboardTheme.standard(
    .init(tint: .black)
)
```

Style variations make it easy to play within the style of a theme, and only modify the parts that are meant to be changed by the theme.


### Custom themes

You can create completely custom themes, like this one that changes the primary button color:

```swift
extension KeyboardTheme {

    static var myCustomTheme: KeyboardTheme {
        get throws {
            var theme = try? KeyboardTheme(
                primaryBackgroundColor: .green
            )
        }
    }
}
```

You can also use another theme as a template and tweak any parts of it:

```swift
extension KeyboardTheme {

    static var anotherTheme: KeyboardTheme {
        get throws {
            var theme = try? KeyboardTheme.standard
            theme.buttonStyles[.primary]?.backgroundColor = .green
            return theme
        }
    }
}
```

You can then access your theme with `KeyboardTheme.myCustomTheme` or just `.myCustomTheme` when passing in the theme as a function parameter.


### Theme-based styling

Once you have a theme that you want to use, you can use the `ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider`:

```swift
override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
    super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()

    // Setup KeyboardKit Pro with a license
    try? setupPro(withLicenseKey: "LICENSE_KEY_HERE") { _ in
        keyboardStyleProvider = ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider(
            theme: .cottonCandy,
            keyboardContext: keyboardContext
        )
    }
}
```

This will make any view that uses the style provider (like ``SystemKeyboard``) use this theme. You can change this theme at any time.

You can inherit `ThemeBasedKeyboardStyleProvider` to customize this theme-based provider even further, which lets you mix the benefits of themes and styles in even more ways.

> Important: Since the theme engine requires KeyboardKit Pro, you must register this provider *after* registering your KeyboardKit Pro license key. 


### Pre-defined themes

You can access all pre-defined themes with `KeyboardTheme.{ID}`, for instance `KeyboardKit.standard` or `KeyboardKit.minimal(.pink)`. 

[This page](/themes) lists all pre-defined themes with some style variations.

You can access all pre-defined themes with `KeyboardTheme.allPredefined`. All pre-defined style variations also have an `allPredefined` property, e.g. `KeyboardTheme.SwiftyStyle.allPredefined`.


### Previews

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks powerful tools to preview themes:

```swift
SystemKeyboardThemePreview(...)         // A live theme preview.
SystemKeyboardThemePreviewHeader(...)   // A live theme preview header.
```

Since these views render system keyboards with full interation, they are quite performance demanding. 

To preview many themes at once, you can use this more lightweight preview:

```swift
SystemKeyboardButtonThemePreview(...)   // A system button preview for a theme.
```

This preview only renders lightweight buttons. See <doc:Essentials> for more information.


### License Requirements

The KeyboardKit Pro theme engine requires a `Gold` license.
