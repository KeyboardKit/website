Some keyboards may need to identify the host application, which is the app that is currently using the keyboard extension. This can be used to adjust the style, behavior or features for certain apps.

Keyboard lets you get the bundle ID of the current host application. This is used to power features like [dictation](/features/dictation), where the app should navigate back to the keyboard when dictation finishes.
