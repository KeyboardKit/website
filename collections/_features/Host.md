KeyboardKit provides ways to easily identify the host application, which may be of interest for many reasons, e.g. to vary the style of functionality of a keyboard based on the active app.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an [additional list of popular applications](#pro), to make it even easier to get the exact identify of the active app.


## Core Features

``KeyboardInputViewController`` has a ``.hostApplicationBundleId`` property that tries to resolve the ID of the application that is currently using the keyboard.

``KeyboardContext`` also has a ``.hostApplicationBundleId`` property syncs with the controller value. Since you shouldn't pass around the controller, this may be more convenient to use.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a ``KeyboardHostApplication`` enum that defines a bunch of commonly used applications. This will be expanded over time, so reach out if you miss a certain app.

The ``KeyboardInputViewController`` and ``KeyboardContext`` are both extended with a `hostApplication` property, that tries to return a specific application.
