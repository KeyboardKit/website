Some keyboards may need to identify the [host application](/terminology), which is the app that is currently using the keyboard. This is needed to configure or style the keyboard for certain apps.

Keyboard lets you read the bundle ID of the host application. This is used by features like [dictation](/features/dictation), where the app should navigate back to the keyboard when dictation finishes.
