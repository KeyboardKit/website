## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks ways to identify and integrate with a large list of well-known apps. This is for instance used to navigate back to the keyboard from the app when performing dictation.

You can also use this information for other features. KeyboardKit Pro has an extensive directory of known host applications, which can be extended with any app that provides a way to open it.
