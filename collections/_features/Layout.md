title: Layout
---


A flexible keyboard layout is at the heart of a software keyboard, with many considerations like the current device model, screen orientation, locale, etc.

KeyboardKit lets you use input sets to define input keys, and keyboard layouts to define the full set of keys. This gives you maximum flexibility to define layouts for different locales and configurations.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [more features](#pro), like iPad Pro layouts, and localized input sets and layout providers for all supported locales.


## Core Features

An ``InputSet`` specifies the input keys of a keyboard. KeyboardKit has predefined sets like ``.qwerty``, ``.standardNumeric`` and ``.standardSymbolic``. You can easily define your own input sets.

A ``KeyboardLayout`` specifies the full set of keys of a keyboard. It can vary greatly for different device types, screen orientations, locales, etc. You can combine input sets and layouts for great flexibility.

For instance, iOS keyboards often have 3 input rows, where the input keys are surrounded by side buttons, and a bottom row that is often the same across locales.

This is however not always true. Layouts differ between iPhone, iPad & iPad Pro, some locales (like Armenian) have 5 rows, some (like Greek) remove side-buttons, etc.

The layout engine must thus be flexible, to cater to the needs of these considerations. KeyboardKit has a bunch of base classes that define a good starting point.

## ðŸ‘‘ Pro Features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks localized ``InputSet``s and ``KeyboardLayoutProvider``s for all keyboard locales, and will automatically make the `SystemKeyboard` use them, without any additional code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks an `KeyboardLayout.iPadProProvider` that can be used to generate iPad Pro-specific layouts. This provider is used by all supported locales by default.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks ways to easily add an input row at the top of the `SystemKeyboard`. This is great for certain apps, where an additional utility row makes sense.
