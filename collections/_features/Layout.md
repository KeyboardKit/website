A flexible keyboard layout is at the heart of a software keyboard, with many considerations like the current device model, screen orientation, locale, etc.

The KeyboardKit layout engine is flexible and adapts to many factors, like device and keyboard type, locale, etc. You can easily customize the layout further, by resizing, adding and removing keys.
