A flexible keyboard layout is at the heart of a software keyboard, with many considerations like the current device model, screen orientation, locale, etc.

KeyboardKit lets you use ``InputSet``s to define input keys, and ``KeyboardLayout``s to define the full set of keys. This gives you maximum flexibility to define layouts for different locales and configurations.

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can generate dynamic layouts at runtime. This provides the flexibility we need to adjust the layout as needed.
