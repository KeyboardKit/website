A flexible keyboard layout is at the heart of a software keyboard, with many considerations like the current device model, screen orientation, locale, etc.

KeyboardKit lets you use ``InputSet``s to define input keys, and ``KeyboardLayout``s to define the full set of keys. This gives you maximum flexibility to define layouts for different locales and configurations.

Layouts can vary greatly for different devices, screen sizes, orientations, locales, etc. For instance, an Armenian keyboard has 4 rows, a Greek keyboard removes many keys, etc. 

As such, the layout engine must be flexible. In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardLayoutService`` can generate layouts at runtime, which provides us with the flexibility we need to adapt the layout as needed.
