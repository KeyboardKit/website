The native iOS keyboard has more gestures than you may think. Keys can be pressed, released, and long pressed, space can be dragged to move the cursor, shift can be double tapped, etc.

KeyboardKit lets you handle complex gestures with very little code and has a drag gesture handler protocol that can handle various drag gestures, like using space to move the input cursor.
