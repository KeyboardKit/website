KeyboardKit provides keyboard-specific colors that make it easy to mimics a native keyboard style.


## Core Features

KeyboardKit has `Color` extensions that resolve to assets that aim to match iOS system colors, like `.keyboardBackground`, `.keyboardButtonBackground`, `.keyboardButtonForeground`, etc.

KeyboardKit also has contextual colors that take a ``KeyboardContext`` and vary the result based on device, color scheme, etc.


## Important Information

If you take a closer look at these colors, you will notice that some are semi-transparent. The reason for this is to work around a system limitation in iOS. You can read more in the documentation.
