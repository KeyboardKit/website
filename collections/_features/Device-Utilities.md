KeyboardKit has platform-agnostic device functionality that aims to help you use device information to customize your keyboards.



## Device type

KeyboardKit has a ``DeviceType`` enum with platform-agnostic device types. You can use ``.current`` to get the current device type.


## Screen sizes

KeyboardKit has `CGSize` utilities to help detecting the screen size, for instance `.isLargePad(...)`.



## Interface orientation

KeyboardKit has an ``InterfaceOrientation`` enum with platform-agnostic types. You can use ``.current`` to get the current interface orientation.
