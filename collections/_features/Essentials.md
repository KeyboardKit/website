KeyboardKit extends Apple's very imited native keyboard APIs with a lot more features than what is otherwise available.

KeyboardKit lets you create a fully customizable [custom keyboard](/about/terminology) with a few lines of code, and will automatically set up things like App Group settings sync, locales, dictation, etc.

KeyboardKit has essential features & views, and a fully customizable [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) that lets you mimic a native iOS keyboard.

## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks even more essential features, makes the [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) support all [{{site.locales.count}} supported locales](/locales), etc.

KeyboardKit also provides [additional app utilities](/features/app), that lets you set up a full-blown main app with keyboard status handling, settings screens, etc. Be up and running in minutes, with very little code.

[Pro]: /pro
