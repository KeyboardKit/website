KeyboardKit extends Apple's native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic a native keyboard and tweak its style & behavior, or create completely custom ones.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [more essential features](#pro) like `SystemKeyboard` add-ons, components, etc.


## Namespaces

KeyboardKit uses namespaces to group types into logical collections, to make the SDK easier to use.

The ``Keyboard`` namespace contains essential, keyboard-related models & views, including types like ``AutocapitalizationType``, ``KeyboardCase``, ``KeyboardType``, ``ReturnKeyType``, etc.


## Controller

The ``KeyboardInputViewController`` is the most essential type in the library. Just make your controller inherit this class to get access to a lot of additional capabilities.


## Context

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardContext`` that provides observable state that keeps your UI up to date, as well as persistent settings that automatically sync between the main app and its keyboard.


## Keyboard View

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardView`` that mimics a native iOS keyboard. It supports all locales, layouts & callouts, can be styled with styles & themes, can customize all toolbars & views, etc.:

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img alt="An English KeyboardView" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-english.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="A styled KeyboardView" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-styled.jpg" /></div>
</div>

KeyboardKit Pro adds a lot of functionality to this keyboard, to make it more powerful and flexible.


## Views

Besides `KeyboardView`, the `Keyboard` namespace has many additional views and styles, like ``Button``, ``ButtonStyle``, ``NextKeyboardButton``, ``Toolbar``, etc.
