KeyboardKit extends Apple's limited native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more features than what is otherwise available.

KeyboardKit lets you set up a custom keyboard with just a few lines of code, and will automatically set up things like App Group-based data sync between the app and keyboard, locales, dictation, etc.

KeyboardKit has essential models, services, features & views, and a [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) component that lets you mimic a native, fully customizable iOS keyboard view.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks even more essential features, makes the [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) support all [{{site.locales.count}} supported locales](/locales), etc.

KeyboardKit also provides [additional app utilities](/features/app), that lets you set up a full-blown main app with keyboard status handling, settings screens, etc. Be up and running in minutes, with very little code.
