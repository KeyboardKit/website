As you may have noticed, Apple's native custom keyboard APIs are limited, and forces you to build a lot of things from scratch, including the very keyboard view itself.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic native iOS keyboards and tweak their style & behavior, or create completely custom ones.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [more essential features](#pro) like `SystemKeyboard` add-ons, components, etc.


## Core Features

The ``KeyboardInputViewController`` is the most essential type in the library. Just make your controller inherit this class to get access to a bunch of additional capabilities.

KeyboardKit also has a ``Keyboard`` namespace with keyboard-related types, like ``Case``, ``ReturnKeyType`` etc., as well as other essential types like ``KeyboardContext`` and  ``KeyboardBehavior``.


KeyboardKit has a ``SystemKeyboard`` that mimics a native iOS keyboard. It can be used for alphabetic, numeric & symbolic keyboards,  supports all supported locales, layouts, callouts, etc.:

`SystemKeyboard` automatically adapts for portrait & landscape, iPhone & iPad, can be extended with emoji keyboards and toolbars, and can be styled to great extent:

KeyboardKit Pro adds a lot of functionality to this keyboard, to make it more powerful and flexible.
