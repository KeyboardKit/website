KeyboardKit extends Apple's very limited native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality than what is otherwise available.

KeyboardKit provides essential models, services, features and views, as well as a [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) component that lets you mimic a native, fully customizable iOS keyboard view.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks even more essential features, makes the [KeyboardView](/features/essential-keyboardview) support all [{{site.locales.count}} supported locales](/locales), etc.
