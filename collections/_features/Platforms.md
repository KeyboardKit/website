KeyboardKit supports all major Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS) and can be used to create keyboard-oriented apps on all platforms.

So even if you may think that it may make little sense to create a keyboard app for, say, Apple TV, you can still use KeyboardKit's models, settings, etc. to extend your product offering.

One example could be a macOS companion app that lets users manage App Group-synced settings, create keyboard settings-related widgets for quick access on the Apple Watch, etc.


## How does it work?

Since KeyboardKit is a closed-source library, it must be explicitly built for each platform. This means that we must explicitly create separate tags for each platform combination.

Given that this involve additional complexities in the release creation process, we only provide this to [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] customers (Gold and above), who [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) to us regarding this.


## Android

Although Android support hasn't been requested that much in the past, more companies are asking for this as a way to use the same keyboard engine on both platforms.

We have so far been focused on making KeyboardKit the best it can be for Swift and SwiftUI, but are investigating what it would involve to also support Android.

Please [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) if you need Android support, or if you'd be willing to invest in making this happen.



## üëë KeyboardKit Pro

By signing up for [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] Gold or higher, you can [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) to adjust the release process to involve the platforms you need.
