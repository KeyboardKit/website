Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are often needed by AI-powered keyboards.

For instance, keyboards may need to read the *entire* document to be able to spell-check and proof-read the text, let users type within the keyboard to prompt or type intents, etc.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [features](#pro) that make it easier to add AI-based functionality to a keyboard.


### Full Document Reader

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways for the document proxy to read *all* text from any text field, by moving the text input cursor in ways that unlock more content. 

See the [proxy utilities article](/features/proxy-utilities/) for more information.


### Next Word Prediction

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to use 3rd party tools like Claude and OpenAI to perform next word prediction. This makes autocomplete even better.

See the [autocomplete article](/features/autocomplete) for more information.


### Text Input

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks text input components that let you type directly within the keyboard. This lets you provide prompt-based features to your users.

See the [text input article](/features/text-input) for more information.
