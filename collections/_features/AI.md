Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are often needed for AI-powered keyboards.

For instance, keyboards may need to read the *entire* document to be able to spell-check and proof-read, allow users to type within the keyboard, etc. 

Such features can be hard to implement, but KeyboardKit Pro lets you do this with almost no code.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [features](#pro) that make it easier to add AI-based functionality to a keyboard.


### Document Reader

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways for the document proxy to read *all* text from any text field, by moving the text input cursor to unlock more content. See [proxy utilities](/features/proxy-utilities/) for more information.


### Next Word Prediction

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to use 3rd party tools like Claude and OpenAI to perform next word prediction. This makes autocomplete even better. See [autocomplete](/features/autocomplete) for more information.


### Text Input

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks text input components that let you type directly within the keyboard. This lets you provide prompt-based features to your users. See [text input](/features/text-input) for more information.
