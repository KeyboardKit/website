Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are often needed by AI-powered keyboards.

For instance, keyboards may need to read the entire document to be able to perform spellchecking and proofreading, and let users type within the keyboard to prompt or type intents.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [features](#pro) that make it easier to add AI-based functionality to a keyboard.
