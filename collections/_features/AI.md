Apple's native keyboard APIs lack many features that are often needed by AI-powered keyboards.

For instance, keyboards may need to read the entire document to be able to perform spellchecking and proofreading, and let users type within the keyboard to prompt or type intents.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [features](#pro) that make it easier to add AI-based functionality to a keyboard.


### Full Document Reader

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to read *all* text from any text field, by moving the text cursor in ways that unlock more content. 

See the [proxy utilities article](/features/proxy-utilities/) for more information.


### Next Word Prediction

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to use 3rd party support to perform next word prediction, e.g. using external services like OpenAI and Claude. 

See the [autocomplete article](/features/autocomplete) for more information.
