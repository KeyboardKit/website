In KeyboardKit, the ``KeyboardAction`` enum defines keyboard-specific actions that can be triggered by the keyboard or programmatically, and handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``.


## Keyboard Action

The ``KeyboardAction`` enum defines many keyboard-related actions, like ``.character(_:)``, ``.backspace``, ``.nextLocale``, etc. It's also a namespace for many action-related types & views.


## Action Handler

Actions can be triggered by button taps, system events, or triggered programmatically, and handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``. You can create a custom handler to customize the action behavior.
