In KeyboardKit, the ``KeyboardAction`` enum defines keyboard-specific actions that can be triggered by the keyboard, or with code, and handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``.

The ``KeyboardAction`` enum defines many keyboard-related actions, like ``.character(_:)``, ``.backspace``, ``.nextLocale``, ``.nextKeyboard``, etc. It's also a namespace for action-related types & views.

Actions can be triggered by buttons, gestures, system events, or with code, and can be handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``. You can create a custom handler to adjust the keyboard behavior.
