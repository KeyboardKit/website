KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardAction`` enum that defines keyboard-specific actions , like ``.character``, ``.backspace``, ``.nextLocale``, ``.nextKeyboard``, etc. It's also a namespace for action-related types & views.

Actions can be triggered by buttons, gestures, system events, or code, and can be handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``. You can create a custom handler to adjust the standard keyboard behavior.
