KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardAction`` enum that defines keyboard-specific actions , like ``.character``, ``.backspace``, ``.nextLocale``, ``.nextKeyboard``, etc. It's also a namespace for action-related types & views.

Actions can be triggered by buttons, gestures, system events, or code, and can be handled with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``. You can create a custom handler to adjust the standard keyboard behavior.

The keyboard action context makes it very easy to adjust the behavior of your keyboard. You can basically handle any action in any way that you want.
