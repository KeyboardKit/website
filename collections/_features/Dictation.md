Dictation can be used to let users enter text by speaking instead of typing. This can be hard to setup in a keyboard extension, where microphone access is unavailable.

KeyboardKit therefore provides dictation-specific tools that you can use to add dictation support to both your keyboard extension and main app.

KeyboardKit has an ``Dictation`` namespace with dictation-related types and views, an observable ``DictationContext``, and a `Dictation.Settings`  with persisted settings.

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can be used to start start dictation from a keyboard extension, by opening its app, perform dictation in the app, then return to the keyboard to use the result.
