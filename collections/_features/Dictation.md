title: Dictation
---

Dictation can be used to let users enter text by speaking instead of typing. This can be hard to setup in a keyboard extension, where microphone access is unavailable.

KeyboardKit therefore provides dictation-specific tools that you can use to add dictation support to both your keyboard extension and main app.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [features](#pro) that can be used to perform app- & keyboard-based dictation.


## Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Dictation`` namespace that contains dictation-related types and views, as well as a ``Screen`` and a ``BarVisualizer`` that are unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro. 


## Context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``DictationContext`` that has observable state and persistent settings, such as a ``silenceLimit`` after which dictation will automatically end.


## Services

In KeyboardKit, a ``DictationService`` can be used to start start dictation from a keyboard extension, by opening its app, perform dictation in the app, then return to the keyboard to use the result.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks dictation services and tools that let you add dictation to the keyboard and main app in a few simple steps, with very little code involved.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks dictation-related views, that let you inspect the dictation progress, like the `Dictation.Screen` and `Dictation.BarVisualizer`.

All dictation components can be customized to great extent. You can use any custom screens and visualizers, or style the existing ones.
