Dictation can be used to let users enter text by speaking instead of typing. This can be hard to setup in a keyboard extension, where microphone access is unavailable.

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks tools that let you add dictation to your keyboard extensions and main app, and makes it easy to start dictation from a keyboard by opening the main app.

KeyboardKit has a ``Dictation`` namespace with dictation-related types, an observable context, auto-persisted settings, dictation services, etc.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks dictation features that let you add dictation support with very little code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks dictation-related views to let you show the dictation progress. These views can be customized and styled to great extent.
