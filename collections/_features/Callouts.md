Callouts are an important part of the typing experience, where input callouts highlight the currently pressed character and action callouts show secondary actions.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [localized callout actions](#pro) for all locales, with no additional code needed.


## Core Features
KeyboardKit has tools to automatically show a ``Callouts.InputCallout`` as a user taps any input key:

![InputCallout]({{page.assets}}inputcallout-350.jpg)

KeyboardKit can also show secondary actions in a ``Callouts.ActionCallout`` when long pressing a key:

![ActionCallout]({{page.assets}}actioncallout-350.jpg)

The `SystemKeyboard` automatically registers everything needed to automatically show these callouts.
