KeyboardKit provides utilities that are meant to be used in the main app target, to build a great app that can provide the user with settings, configurations, etc.


## ðŸ‘‘ Pro Features

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``KeyboardApp.HomeScreen`` that can be used by a main keyboard app target:

The screen renders an app icon header, then adds a keyboard status section that is surrounded by custom top and bottom content views.
