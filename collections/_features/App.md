KeyboardKit Pro provides utility types for the main app target of a keyboard app.


## Home Screen

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``KeyboardApp.HomeScreen`` that can be used by a main keyboard app target:

The screen renders an app icon header, then adds a keyboard status section that is surrounded by custom top and bottom content views.

The view can be styled & localized to great extent, using the `.keyboardAppHomeScreen` view modifiers.
