KeyboardKit has ways to check the keyboard status, e.g. if a keyboard is enabled in Settings, if Full Access is enabled, if the keyboard is actively being used, etc.

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardStatus`` namespace that contains status-related types and an observable context that can be used to observe the status of one or several keyboards.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional status views & utilities, like a complete ``KeyboardStatus.Section``:

<img width="450" alt="A keyboard status section" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardstatussection.jpg" />

The view is used by the [KeyboardApp.HomeScreen](/features/app) screen, and can be used as a standalone view.
