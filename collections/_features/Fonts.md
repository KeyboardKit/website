KeyboardKit makes it easy to apply a custom unicode font to your keyboard, to let users type with a different font than the standard system font.

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks custom font capabilities for licenses that include the ``fonts`` feature. This is NOT part of the Gold tier, and must be enabled with a custom license agreement.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a feeedback settings screen that can be used in the app or keyboard.

<div class="grid col2">
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}fonts-settingsscreen.jpg" /></span>
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-font.jpg" /></span>
</div>

By setting the `FontSettings.font`, the `KeyboardView` will automatically add the font to its keys. When the user types, the selected unicode font will be used and not the standard font.
