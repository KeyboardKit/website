KeyboardKit can apply a custom unicode font to your keyboard, to let users type with custom fonts.

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks custom font capabilities for licenses that include the ``fonts`` feature. This is **NOT** part of the Gold tier, but must be enabled through a custom license agreement.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a font settings screen that can be added to the app or keyboard, in which users can select custom unicode font in a list.

<div class="grid col2">
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}fonts-settingsscreen.jpg" /></span>
    <span><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-font.jpg" /></span>
</div>

Selecting a font in the list (or setting `FontSettings.font` programatically) will automatically apply the font to the `KeyboardView`, after which users will be able to type with that font.
