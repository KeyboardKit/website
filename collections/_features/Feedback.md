Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where the keyboard can trigger audio and haptic feedback when a user taps on a key or performs an action.

KeyboardKit makes it easy to trigger feedback when the user interacts with the keyboard, as part of other events, etc. You can easily customize the audio and haptic feedback for every action.

KeyboardKit has an ``KeyboardFeedback`` namespace that contains feedback-related types and views, an observable context, and auto-persisted settings, as well as services for triggering feedback.
