title: Feedback
---

Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where the keyboard can play audio and trigger haptic feedback to indicate that the user has tapped a key or performed an action.

In KeyboardKit, feedback can be triggered with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``, or by triggering the ``AudioFeedback`` and ``HapticFeedback`` feedback types directly.



## Audio feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``AudioFeedback`` enum that defines various audio feedback types. 

You can trigger audio feedback types directly, using ``.trigger()``:

```swift
AudioFeedback.input.trigger()
```

This enum also serves as a namespace for types like ``Configuration`` and ``Engine``.



## Haptic feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``HapticFeedback`` enum that defines various haptic feedback types. 

You can trigger haptic feedback types directly, using ``.trigger()``:

```swift
HapticFeedback.lightImpact.trigger()
```

This enum also serves as a namespace for types like ``Configuration`` and ``Engine``.



## How to configure feedback

KeyboardKit has an observable ``FeedbackConfiguration`` class that can be used to configure feedback for various actions. KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and binds it to ``.state``. 

You can use this settings instance to customize the feedback configuration:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let config = state.feedbackConfiguration 
        config.audioConfiguration = .disabled
        config.audioConfiguration.input = .custom(id: 1329)
        config.hapticConfiguration = .enabled
    }
}
```

Since the settings class is observable, any changes to it will automatically cause the keyboard view to update, e.g. if you have toggles for audio and haptic feedback.



## How to define custom audio feedback

The ``AudioFeedback`` enum has predefined sounds for various keyboard-specific types. It uses `AudioServices`, which means that you can use any system audio as audio feedback, for instance:

```swift
extension AudioFeedback {

    static let sentMessage = .custom(id: 1004)
}
```
