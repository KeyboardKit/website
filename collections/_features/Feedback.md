title: Feedback
---

Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where the keyboard can play audio and trigger haptic feedback when a user taps on a key or performs an action.

In KeyboardKit, feedback can be triggered with a ``KeyboardActionHandler`` or by using ``AudioFeedback`` and ``HapticFeedback`` directly.


## Audio feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``AudioFeedback`` enum that defines various audio feedback types. It also serves as a namespace for audio feedback-related types.


## Haptic feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``HapticFeedback`` enum that defines various haptic feedback types. It also serves as a namespace for haptic feedback-related types.


## Feedback Configuration

KeyboardKit has an observable ``FeedbackConfiguration`` that can be used to configure the feedback.
