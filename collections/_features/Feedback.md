Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where the keyboard can trigger audio and haptic feedback when a user taps on a key or performs an action.

KeyboardKit makes it easy to trigger feedback when the user interacts with the keyboard, as part of other events, etc. You can easily customize the audio and haptic feedback for every single action.

KeyboardKit has an ``KeyboardFeedback`` namespace that contains feedback-related types and views, an observable ``KeyboardFeedbackContext``, and an `KeyboardFeedback.Settings`  with persisted settings.

In KeyboardKit, a ``KeyboardFeedbackService`` can be used to trigger audio & haptic feedback as users interact with the keyboard. The ``KeyboardActionHandler`` protocol also implements this protocol.
