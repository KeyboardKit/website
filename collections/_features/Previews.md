SwiftUI previews are a great way to work on your design in Xcode without having to launch the app to see the result. Just update your views and models, and the preview will update.

KeyboardKit has preview-specific services and state that can be used in your previews. This makes it easy to preview your keyboard-specific views directly in Xcode.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a `KeyboardViewPreview` that can preview a ``KeyboardView`` in the main app, for instance to show the result of various styling and configurations:

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-english.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-swedish-theme.jpg" /></div>
</div>

There's also a more lightweight `Keyboard.ButtonPreview` that lets you preview several buttons styles.
