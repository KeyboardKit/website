SwiftUI previews are a great way to work on your design in Xcode without having to launch the app to see the result. Just update your views and models, and the preview will update.

KeyboardKit has preview-specific services and state, that can be used in your previews. This makes it easy to set up and preview your keyboard-specific views directly in Xcode.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a `KeyboardViewPreview` that can preview a ``KeyboardView`` in the main app.

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-english.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img src="{{page.assets}}keyboardviewpreview-theme.jpg" /></div>
</div>

This makes it easy to display the result of various style, settings and configurations to your users.

Since the preview renders a full keyboard, there's a lightweight `Keyboard.ButtonPreview` that lets you preview many themes or styles at once.
