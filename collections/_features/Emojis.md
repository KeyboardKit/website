KeyboardKit provides you with an ``Emoji`` type that has unicode and emoji information, an emoji localization engine, etc.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an emoji keyboard, as well as emoji categories, keyboards, skintones, version information, etc. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Emojis namespace

KeyboardKit has an ``Emojis`` namespace that contains emoji-related types and views. KeyboardKit Pro adds more features to this namespace.



## Emoji

KeyboardKit has an ``Emoji`` struct that lets you work with emojis in a more structured way:

```swift
let emoji = Emoji("😀")
```

This type provides you with a bunch of information, such as the emoji's unique unicode-based identifier and name, localized name etc.:

```swift
let emoji = Emoji("😀")
emoji.unicodeIdentifier  // \\N{GRINNING FACE}
emoji.unicodeName        // Grinning Face
```

Emojis can be localized with the localization files found in the `Sources/Resources` folder. Emojis that lack a localized name will use ``Emoji/unicodeName`` as a fallback.

```swift
let emoji = Emoji("😀")
emoji.localizedName(for: .english)  // Grinning Face
emoji.localizedName(for: .swedish)  // Leende Ansikte
```

To localize emojis for a locale, add translations to the correct `Localizable.strings` file on this format:

```
/* [😀] */ "Emoji.GrinningFace" = "Grinning Face";
/* [😃] */ "Emoji.SmilingFaceWithOpenMouth" = "Smiling Face with Open Mouth";
```

Emoji localization is a major undertaking and will therefore have to be a community effort.



## String & Character Extensions

KeyboardKit has String and Character extensions to detect emojis, for instance:

```swift
"Hello!".containsEmoji          // false
"Hello! 👋".containsEmoji       // true
"Hello! 👋".containsOnlyEmojis  // false
"👋".containsOnlyEmojis         // true
"Hello! 👋😀".emojis            // ["👋", "😀"]
"Hello! 👋😀".emojiString       // "👋😀"
"🫸🫷".isSingleEmoji            // false
"👍".isSingleEmoji              // true
```

These extensions make it easier to make emoji-based decisions for text values.



## 👑 Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an emoji keyboard, categories, keyboards, skintones, version info, etc.


### Emoji Keyboard

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an `EmojiKeyboard` that mimics the native emoji keyboard.

The keyboard uses a bunch of views that are also unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro, such as the `Emojis.Grid`, as well as titles, menus, etc. You can use these views as standalone components as well. 


### Emoji Categories

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an `Emojis.Category` enum that defines all available emoji categories and their emojis, for instance:

```swift
Emojis.Category.smileys.emojis    // 😀😃😄😁😆🥹😅😂🤣🥲 ...
Emojis.Category.animals.emojis    // 🐶🐱🐭🐹🐰🦊🐻🐼🐻‍❄️🐨 ...
```

You can get a list of all available categories like this:

```swift
Emojis.Category.all     // [.frequent, .smileys, .animals, ...]
```

and use these categories to get a list of all available emojis:

```swift
Emoji.all     // 😀😃😄😁😆🥹😅😂🤣🥲 ...
```

Emoji categories are also used to power the `EmojiKeyboard`.


### Emoji Skin tones

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional ``Emoji`` extensions to get skin tone information:

```swift
Emoji("👍").hasSkinToneVariants     // true
Emoji("🚀").hasSkinToneVariants     // false
Emoji("👍🏿").neutralSkinToneVariant  // 👍
Emoji("👍").skinToneVariants        // 👍👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
Emoji("👍").skinToneVariantActions  // The above variants as keyboard actions
```

Skin tones will also be used as secondary callout actions, which means that long pressing an emoji with skintones in an emoji keyboard will show an action callout. 

Note that skin tone support for emojis with multiple skin tone components is currently not supported, such as two persons kissing.


### Emoji Versions

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an `EmojiVersion` type that defines emoji versions, platform availability and included emojis, for instance:

```swift
let version = EmojiVersion.v15
version.version  // 15.0
version.iOS      // 16.4
version.macOS    // 13.3
version.tvOS     // 16.4
version.watchOS  // 9.4
```

You can also get the emoji version included in a certain platform version, for instance:

```swift
let version = EmojiVersion(iOS: 15.4)
version.version  // 14.0
```

A version specifies the emojis introduced in that version, later and older versions and emojis that were introduced in later versions:

```swift
let version = EmojiVersion.v14
version.emojis            // 🫠🫢🫣🫡🫥🫤🥹...
version.laterVersions     // [.v15]
version.olderVersions     // []
version.unavailableEmojis // 🫨🫸🫷🪿🫎🪼🫏🪽...
```

This can be used to filter out unavailable emojis from the various categories, which lets the emoji keyboard only list available emojis.


### Most recent emojis

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an `Emojis.MostRecentProvider` and replaces ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler`` with a `ProKeyboardActionHandler` that automatically registers emojis as you use them.
