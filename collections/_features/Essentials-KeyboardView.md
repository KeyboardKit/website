KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardView`` that lets you mimic a native iOS keyboard with a few lines of code.

<div class="grid col2">
    <div><img alt="An English KeyboardView" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-english.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img alt="A styled KeyboardView" src="{{page.assets}}keyboardview-styled.jpg" /></div>
</div>

The `KeyboardView` automatically applies all configurations and settings from the various context and settings classes, as well as applying complex gestures and callouts to all its keys.

The keyboard view is highly customizable. It supports custom layouts and callouts, and lets you use custom views, styles, and themes for any part of the keyboard.
