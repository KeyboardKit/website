KeyboardKit has a few general buttons that can be used to mimic native keyboard buttons. It doesn't require you to use the views and buttons in the library, but it can help speed up development.



## Keyboard Button

The ``KeyboardButton`` namespace defines a couple of button types that help you mimic native keyboard buttons. You can also use the `.keyboardButton` view modifier to convert any view to a keyboard button.



## Next Keyboard Button

The ``NextKeyboardButton`` can be used to trigger the system's keyboard switcher function, which selects the next keyboard when tapped and shows a keyboard menu when long pressed.
