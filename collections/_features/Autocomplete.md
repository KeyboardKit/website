Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where autocomplete suggestions can be shown as the user types, and autocorrect can automatically correct the typed text.

## Core Features

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteProvider`` can provide suggestions that automatically update views like the customizable ``Autocomplete.Toolbar``.
