Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where autocomplete suggestions can be shown as the user types, and autocorrect can automatically correct the typed text.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [local & remote autocomplete](#pro) and automatically enables autocomplete.


## Core Features

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteProvider`` can provide suggestions that automatically update views like the customizable ``Autocomplete.Toolbar``.

There's also an ``Autocomplete`` namespace with autocomplete-related types, observable state, etc.

## ðŸ‘‘ Pro Features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks local and remote autocomplete, and makes KeyboardKit automatically perform autocomplete as the user types, without any additional code needed.

The `Autocomplete.LocalProvider` uses device capabilities to perform autocomplete on-device, while an `Autocomplete.RemoteProvider` can be used to integrate with external APIs.
