title: Autocomplete
---

Autocomplete is a very important part of the typing experience, where suggestions can be shown as the user types, and autocorrections can automatically correct the typed text.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks [local & remote autocomplete](#pro) and automatically enables autocomplete for many of the supported languages when you register a valid license key.


## Core Features

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteService`` can be used to get suggestions that automatically update views like the (very customizable) ``Autocomplete.Toolbar``.

There's also an ``Autocomplete`` namespace with autocomplete-related types, observable state, etc.
