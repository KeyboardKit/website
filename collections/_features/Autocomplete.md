Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where word suggestions can be shown as the user types, and autocorrections can automatically correct mistyped words.

KeyboardKit has an ``Autocomplete`` namespace that contains autocomplete-related types and views, an observable context, auto-persisted settings, an autocomplete service model, etc.


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks local autocomplete for many of the [{{site.locales.count}} supported languages](/locales), as well as a remote autocomplete service (Gold) that can integrate with any remote API.

KeyboardKit Pro will automatically perform next-character predictions on the autocomplete result, which is used for "Predictive Typing", where the tap area is increased for more probable keys.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks ways to use 3rd party services to perform [next word prediction](/features/ai). You can enable OpenAI and Claude integrations with a single line of code.
