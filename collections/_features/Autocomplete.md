Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where word suggestions can be shown as the user types, and autocorrections can automatically correct mistyped words.

KeyboardKit has an ``Autocomplete`` namespace that contains autocomplete-related types and views, an observable context, auto-persisted settings, an autocomplete service model, etc.

You must use KeyboardKit Pro to unlock an `AutocompleteService` that can autocomplete the typed text and perform predictions, or implement a custom service from scratch.


## 👑 KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks local autocomplete for many of the [{{site.locales.count}} supported languages](/locales), as well as a remote autocomplete service (Gold) that can integrate with any remote API.

The `StandardAutocompleteService` that is unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro will autocomplete typed text, and perform various predictions, like next character prediction.


### Next Word Prediction

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks ways to use Apple Intelligence and 3rd party tools like Claude and OpenAI to perform next word prediction. You can enable OpenAI and Claude with a single line of code.


### Next Character Prediction

KeyboardKit Pro can use autocomplete to perform next character prediction, to predict which keys that are more likely to be pressed next.


### Predictive Typing

KeyboardKit Pro can use next character prediction to enable "Predictive Typing", where the key tap area is increased for more probable keys.
