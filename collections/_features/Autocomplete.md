title: Autocomplete
---

Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where autocomplete suggestions are shown as the current text changes.

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteProvider`` can provide suggestions to an ``AutocompleteContext``, which in turn can update views like an ``AutocompleteToolbar`` automatically through state observation.

KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard provider as it has for other services. Instead, it binds a disabled provider to ``.services`` until you replace it with a custom provider or activate KeyboardKit Pro.

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks and registers a local autocomplete provider. More information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Autocomplete namespace

KeyboardKit has an ``Autocomplete`` namespace that contains autocomplete-related types.

The namespace doesn't contain protocols, open classes or types that are meant to be top-level ones. It's meant to contain types used by top-level types, to make the library easier to overview.



## Autocomplete context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``AutocompleteContext`` class that provides autocomplete state, such as the suggestions to present.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and binds it to ``.state``, then updates it when autocomplete is performed.



## How to perform autocomplete

KeyboardKit will call ``performAutocomplete()`` when the text changes. This will update the ``.state`` context with suggestions from the main ``.services`` provider. 

You can use these suggestions in any way you like. Views like the ``AutocompleteToolbar`` will update to present the latest suggestions, and handle any tapped suggestion with the main action handler.

You are of course not restricted to use an ``AutocompleteToolbar``. You can use and present suggestions in any way you want.

If you need to reset autocomplete state, you can call the context ``.reset()`` functions. You can also set the context ``.isEnabled`` to false to disable autocomplete altogether.



## How to customize the autocomplete behavior

You can customize the autocomplete behavior by replacing the ``.services`` provider with a custom ``AutocompleteProvider`` or by overriding the various ``KeyboardInputViewController`` functions.

For instance, the ``.autocompleteText`` property determines which text to pass into the provider. It uses ``.textDocumentProxy`` by default, but you can override it to customize which text to use.

If you want to temporarily or permanently disable autocomplete, just can also set the context ``.isEnabled`` to `false`.



## How to create a custom autocomplete provider

You can replace the ``.services`` autocomplete provider with a custom provider, for instance if you want to integrate with a custom SDK or 3rd party provider.

For instance, here's a custom provider that just adds a suffix to the provided text's current word:

```swift
class FakeAutocompleteProvider: AutocompleteProvider {

    init(match: String = "match") {
        self.match = match
    }

    private var match: String
    
    var locale: Locale = .current
    
    var canIgnoreWords: Bool { false }
    var canLearnWords: Bool { false }
    var ignoredWords: [String] = []
    var learnedWords: [String] = []
    
    func hasIgnoredWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func hasLearnedWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func ignoreWord(_ word: String) {}
    func learnWord(_ word: String) {}
    func removeIgnoredWord(_ word: String) {}
    func unlearnWord(_ word: String) {}
    
    func autocompleteSuggestions(
        for text: String
    ) async throws -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        guard text.count > 0 else { return [] }
        if text == match {
            return matchSuggestions()
        } else {
            return fakeSuggestions(for: text)
        }
    }
}

private extension FakeAutocompleteProvider {
    
    func fakeSuggestions(for text: String) -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: text + "-1"),
            .init(text: text + "-2", subtitle: "Subtitle"),
            .init(text: text + "-3")
        ]
    }
    
    func fakeSuggestion(_ text: String, _ subtitle: String? = nil) -> Autocomplete.Suggestion {
        .init(text: text, subtitle: subtitle)
    }

    func matchSuggestions() -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: match, isUnknown: true),
            .init(text: match, isAutocorrect: true),
            .init(text: match),
        ]
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just set the ``.services`` provider to this custom one:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        services.autocompleteProvider = CustomAutocompleteProvider()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.   



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional autocomplete providers and binds a `LocalAutocompleteProvider` instance to ``.services``.

### LocalAutocompleteProvider

This provider uses on-device capabilities to perform autocomplete. It works offline, doesn't require full access and integrates with other system components, like the on-device lexicon.

You can inherit and customize this provider to modify its default behavior.

### RemoteAutocompleteProvider

This provider can be used to integrate with external REST-based APIs and web services. All you have to do is to specify endpoints and various parameters, and a model that matches the service response.

Since most autocomplete APIs require a token or some form of authentication, the demo app doesn't show this provider in action.
