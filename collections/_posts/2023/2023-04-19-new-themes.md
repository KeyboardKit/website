The upcoming KeyboardKit 7.4 adds many new style variations to the existing themes, as well as a brand new Aestetic theme from the community.

## New standard theme styles

The `Standard` theme is extended with new style variations. The addition of `.green`,  `.purple` and `.yellow` means that the standard theme now has 6 color variations in total.

![Standard Green]({{page.assets}}standard-green.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}
![Standard Purple]({{page.assets}}standard-purple.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}
![Standard Yellow]({{page.assets}}standard-yellow.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}

Both `Swifty` and `Minimal` now support standard theme style variations, which means that they can be styled in the same way as the standard theme, for instance:

![Swifty Green]({{page.assets}}swifty-green.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}
![Minimal Purple]({{page.assets}}minimal-purple.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}

This change means that it will be a lot easier to add new styles to all these themes moving forward.


## Renamed Candy theme

The `Candy` theme will be renamed to `Candy Shop` and add a new, tasty `.cuppyCake` style:

![Candy Shop - Cuppy Cake]({{page.assets}}candyshop-cuppycake.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}

The theme should have a playful background image, to give a picnicky kind of vibe, but it has to be added in a future update.


## New Aesthetic theme

The new `Aesthetic` theme comes from the community. It's a bit experimental at this point, but it currently has a `.boho` style that fits the Boho aesthetic:

![Aesthetic - Boho]({{page.assets}}aesthetic-boho.jpg){:width="{{page.image-width}}" class="theme"}

Future versions may add more style configuration options, but the theme can currently change the background and button styles of all button types.



## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 7.4 adds many new emojis and emoji-related features, as well as new themes and style variations to existing themes. See [this page](/pro/themes) for a list of all available themes.

KeyboardKit 7.4 will be released during the second half of April.
