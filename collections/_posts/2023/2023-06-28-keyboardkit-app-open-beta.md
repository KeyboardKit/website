The current [KeyboardKit app]({{site.urls.appstore}}) was released almost two years ago, and lets you create keyboards and themes that you can share with others.

While this app is capable and has many great features, this first version was too complicated and used many concepts that were hard to understand.

It's therefore exciting to announce that a brand new app is coming to the App Store! This version is much easier to use and lets you be more creative with fewer steps.

The new version is now in open beta, so feel free to [download the app from TestFlight]({{page.beta}}), try it out and let us know what you think.
