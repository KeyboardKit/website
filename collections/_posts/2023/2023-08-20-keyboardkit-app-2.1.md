Version 2.1 of the KeyboardKit app is out! This release adds a bunch of features and improvements to the app, which make it a lot better than the last version.

This version adds a brand new theme - Colorful - which comes with a bunch of pre-defined styles: 

{% include kankoda/grids/grid-screenshots.html folder="themes" images="colorful-black,colorful-blue,colorful-green" %}

{% include kankoda/grids/grid-screenshots.html folder="themes" images="colorful-purple,colorful-red,colorful-white" %}

Other than that, the Keyboard Settings screen has more options, as well as a new keyboard header preview that shows you the result of your configuration. There are also some behavior adjustments that make the keyboard behave even more like the native keyboards.

We hope you like this new version of the KeyboardKit app!
