KeyboardKit 8.2 cleans up the code that is used to localize content for all supported `KeyboardLocale` values. Some keys have been removed and some have been renamed, to make it easier to manage.

There is also a new internal development tool that makes it a lot easier to localize these strings. This will let future versions of KeyboardKit improve the localized strings of all locales.

Finally, KeyboardKit 8.1 adds support for Northern Sámi and Inari Sámi, which brings the number of supported locales to 63.
