Say hello to [Hayatar]({{page.appstore}}) - an Armenian keyboard built by Rotterdam-based [Arshak Aghakaryan]({{page.twitter}}) that aims to improve the Armenian typing experience.

To Arshak Aghakaryan, the current state of typing in Armenian on iOS is not as great as it could be:

> The story of the Armenian typing experience on iOS is quite sad. iOS comes with an Armenian keyboard, but the layout is not one that most who write in Armenian are used to. 

Although several 3rd party Armenian keyboards exists, none has a layout or UI that he expected. As Arshak got an iPad, he started experiencing even more issues with the one that he was using.

> I decided to try and build a keyboard I’d be happy to use myself. I discovered KeyboardKit and fell into a rabbit hole of third-party keyboard development.

After some time in development, Arshak's Armenian keyboard [Hayatar]({{page.appstore}}) is now available on the App Store. It’s open-source, looks and feels native, is customizable and syncs changes to iCloud. 

Plus, since it was designed by an Armenian typer for Armenian typers, it really fits the language.

As you can see in these screenshots, Hayatar provides you with great Armenian alphabetic, numeric and symbolic keyboard layouts, as well as features like autocomplete and secondary callout actions.

> KeyboardKit is definitely one of my favorite packages now!

It's amazing to hear that Arshak loved using KeyboardKit, and that it helped him bring this amazing Armenian keyboard to life. [Download Hayatar]({{page.appstore}}) today, to improve your Armenian typing experience.
