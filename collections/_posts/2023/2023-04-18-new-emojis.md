* 🩶 - Gray Heart
* 🪯 - Khanda
* 🛜 - Wireless

All these emojis will be available in KeyboardKit 7.4.


## Emoji version information

The number of emojis keeps growing, but since emojis require certain system versions, some users may not be able to use (or at least see) the latest additions if they are on older system versions.

KeyboardKit Pro 7.4 will therefore add a new `EmojiVersion` type that specifies all emojis released in certain Emoji versions, as well as in which system versions the Emoji version became available.

This means that you will be able to filter out unavailable emojis from the emoji keyboards. This will be added as standard features to these keyboards in future versions, but just reach out if you need it in place sooner rather than later.


## Emoji localizations

KeyboardKit 7.4 provides localized English names for all emojis.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 7.4 adds many new emojis and emoji-related features. It will be released during April, but you can already try out the open-source additions in the master branch.
