Say hi to Type Devanagari - a Sanskrit keyboard built with KeyboardKit.

[Type Devanagari]({{page.appstore}}) is developed by [@NatashaTheRobot]({{page.twitter}}), who shared this story about how the app came to be:


After starting to learn Sanskrit several years ago, I was surprised to find that the only Sanskrit language keyboard available on iPhone / iPad was the built-in one that was extremely difficult to use and required a whole new system to learn for typing. 

No matter how much I used it, it never became easy, fast, or natural. It became impossible to look up Sanskrit words on the go on mobile as typing each word took such a long time. 

This is when I had an idea to create a Sanskrit keyboard using the standard English keyboard with a few extra characters inspired by the IAST roman script for Devanagari. 

KeyboardKit made it very simple and quick to actually make it! Thank you. 


## Conclusion

Stories like these are so inspiring! Creating a custom keyboard shouldn't have to be hard or take a long time. It's wonderful to hear that [@NatashaTheRobot]({{page.twitter}}) enjoyed building it with KeyboardKit.
