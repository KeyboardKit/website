The WCC Language Program work with and support First Nation's Language Groups to document, promote and develop physical/digital language learning resources. They are currently working with the Wiradjuri, Wemba Wemba/Wamba Wamba, Yorta Yorta and Nari Nari language groups.

The WCC LP approached Anomaly with a bold vision of using cutting-edge mobile technology like computer vision to build delightful educational experiences. Anomaly then supported and used KeyboardKit to implement the [Gurray]({{page.gurray}}) keyboard, which implements indigenous autocomplete that builds on the KeyboardKit autocomplete engine.
