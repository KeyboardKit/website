WCC works with and supports First Nation's Language Groups to document, promote and develop physical/digital language learning resources. They are currently working with the Wiradjuri, Wemba Wemba/Wamba Wamba, Yorta Yorta and Nari Nari language groups.

WCC approached Anomaly with a vision of using cutting-edge mobile technology to build delightful educational experiences. Anomaly then supported and used KeyboardKit to implement the [Gurray]({{page.gurray}}) keyboard, which uses the KeyboardKit system keyboard to mimic a native iOS keyboard and offers outstanding indigenous language features, like autocomplete.

KeyboardKit is honored to play its part of bringing more digital resources and tools to indigenous communities around the world. Thank you [Anomaly Software]({{page.anomaly}}) for all your hard work!
