The [postcast episode]({{page.podcast_apple}}) is very interesting, and connects with the podcasts host's own struggles with bipolar disorder, to provide additional context and illustrate even more, how important BiAffect is.

The team also touches on building additional features on top of the keylogger that is at the heart of the keyboard, and how much effort the BiAffect team puts into protecting user data.

You can listen to the Live Well Bipolar podcast on both [Apple Podcasts]({{page.podcast_apple}}) and [Spotify]({{page.podcast_spotify}}).
