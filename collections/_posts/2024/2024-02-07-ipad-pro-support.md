KeyboardKit 8.3 is out. It adds new features, fixes some bugs, and also adds iPad Pro layout support to KeyboardKit Pro.

iPad Pro uses a completely different layout foundation than the traditional iPad layout. For instance, it adds new system keys to the leading edge, as well as a dedicated caps lock button.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) applies the new layout to almost half of all supported locales. The remaining ones will get it applied over time.
