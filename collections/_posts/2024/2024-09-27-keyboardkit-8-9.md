KeyboardKit 8.9 is out! This a massive update that is built with Xcode 16 and that improves how to set up a keyboard extension, renames services, and adds a bunch of new features.

## üö® Important information

KeyboardKit 8.9 currently has a lot of deprecations, since the structure is being changed and types are being renamed to make the upcoming 9.0 cleaner.


## üõ†Ô∏è Xcode 16

KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro are now built with Xcode 16, using the Swift 6 compiler. While you can still use Xcode 15 with KeyboardKit, KeyboardKit Pro requires Xcode 16.


## üí° New ways to set up KeyboardKit!

This version lets you use a `KeyboardApp` to set up your keyboard extension, and separates setting up the keyboard from setting up the keyboard view.

You can now call `setup(for:)` or `setupPro(for:completion:)` in `viewDidLoad()` to set up a keyboard extension with a `KeyboardApp`, then use `setupKeyboardView(_:)` to set up a custom view.

This change means that you can set up KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro earlier, and that setting up the view is identical for both SDKs. As a bonus, we can add more to the `KeyboardApp` over time.


## üß™ Experiments

The two experimental modes for the next keyboard button seem to work well, and are now enabled by default, as a final test before making them permanent in KeyboardKit 9.

If you face any problems with this change, you can set each mode to `.classic` to revert back. Make sure to report what went wrong, so that it can be adjusted in good time before KeyboardKit 9.


## ‚ú® Features

This version adds a new `Keyboard.NumberPad` component that can be used to render a number pad. The `KeyboardView` will automatically render this when a textfield prefers it.

This version also adds `tryRegisterLocalizedCalloutService` to the `Keyboard.Services` type, to make it easier to register localized callout services, instead of having to cast the current service.

This version also adds `tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService` to the `Keyboard.Services` type, to make it easier to register localized layout services as well.

This version adds more properties to `KeyboardApp`, to make it possible to set up even more with a single app value, both in the app and in the keyboard.

The `KeyboardView` now applies dynamic tap area sizes that are based on next character prediction, which means that more probable keys get a little larger tap area.


## üëë Pro Features

This version adds a new `KeyboardThemeContext`, which can be used to persist themes. It also adds a `KeyboardApp.ThemeScreen` that can be used as a theme picker.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Shorthands

There are many new service shorthands, which makes it easier to refer to implementations. For instance, you can now use `.standard(...)` instead of `KeyboardAction.StandardHandler`.


## üêõ Bug Fixes

This version protect against an undefined key error when using `KeyboardInputViewController` in an app. It also makes sure that replacing some services properly updates other.

This version also fixes a missing callout action for `i` on a Ukrainian keyboard.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 8.9 is a *massive* version that prepares the SDK for the upcoming 9.0. Make sure to test it thoroughly and get in touch if you have feedback or run into any problems.
