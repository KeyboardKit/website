The KeyboardKit Discord is a great place to discuss keyboard extensions in general and KeyboardKit in particular, there are various channels for different topics, release information, etc. 

Gold and Enterprise customers can also get a private, company-specific channel, where you can get quick support and discuss things that are specific to your product.

If you've purchased your license from the [Gumroad e-shop]({{site.urls.gumroad}}), you can access your Discord invite link directly from your purchase information.

If you've purchased your license via KeyboardKit Sales, just [reach out]({{site.email_url}}?subject=Discord) to receive an invite link and a private channel.
