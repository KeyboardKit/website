The KeyboardKit site and online documentation have been extensive rewritten to be more up to date and have more code samples, images, etc.

To keep the massive amount of information managable, the website has been trimmed down to provide basic information, with links to the online documentation for the ones who need it.

Some oages have been converted to feature articles, which helps with discoverability, since each feature article contains a bottom list of links to other articles.

All in all, these changes will hopefully make it easier to find what you're looking for, while still being able to dig deeper whenever you want.
