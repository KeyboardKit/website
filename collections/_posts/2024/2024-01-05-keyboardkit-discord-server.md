Let's kick off 2024 by launching a brand new KeyboardKit Discord Server, where customers can join to discuss keyboard-related ideas, troubleshoot problems, etc.

Last year was a very exciting one, and there are many new things planned for this 2024. 8.2 recently added support for 2 new locales, and the upcoming versions will take the SDK many steps further.

To kick off 2024, a brand new KeyboardKit Discord Server just launched. It's a place to better discuss ideas, troubleshoot problems and share our love (well...interest) for custom keyboards.

The KeyboardKit Discord Server is available to all Gold and Premium customers, and offers private company channels as well as public ones. Just [reach out]({{site.email_url}}) if you want an invite.
