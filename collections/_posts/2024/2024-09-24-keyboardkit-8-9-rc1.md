## üö® Important information

KeyboardKit 8.9 currently has a lot of deprecations, since the structure is being changed and types are being renamed to make the upcoming 9.0 cleaner.


## üí° Renamings and Deprecations

This version continues to rename types to make things more consistent. This means that are now many deprecations, which is all in service for a clean 9.0 transition.


### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Set up changes

This version lets you use a `KeyboardApp` to set up your keyboard extension, and separates setting up the keyboard from setting up the keyboard view.

You can now call `setup(for:)` or `setupPro(for:completion:)` in `viewDidLoad()` to set up a keyboard extension with a `KeyboardApp`, then use the new `setupKeyboardView(_:)` to set up a keyboard view.


### ‚ú® Features

This version adds a new `Keyboard.NumberPad` component that can be used to render a number pad. The `KeyboardView` will automatically render this when a textfield prefers it.

This version also adds `tryRegisterLocalizedCalloutService` to the `Keyboard.Services` type, to make it easier to register localized callouts.

This version also adds `tryRegisterLocalizedLayoutService` to the `Keyboard.Services` type, to make it easier to register localized layouts.

This version adds more properties to `KeyboardApp`, which makes it possible to set up even more things with a single app value, both in the app and in the keyboard.

The `KeyboardView` now applies dynamic tap area sizes that are based on next character prediction, which means that more probable keys get a little larger tap area.


### üëë Pro Features

This version adds a new `KeyboardThemeContext`, which can be used to persist themes. It also adds a `KeyboardApp.ThemeScreen` that can be used as a theme picker.


### ‚ö°Ô∏è Shorthands

There are many new service shorthands, which makes it easier to refer to implementations. For instance, you can now use `.standard(...)` instead of `KeyboardAction.StandardHandler`.


### üêõ Bug Fixes

This version protect against an undefined key error when using `KeyboardInputViewController` in an app. It also makes sure that replacing some services properly updates other.

This version also fixes a missing callout action for `i` on a Ukrainian keyboard.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 8.8 is a massive version that prepares the SDK for the upcoming 9.0. Make sure to test the release candidate and get in touch if you have feedback or run into problems.
