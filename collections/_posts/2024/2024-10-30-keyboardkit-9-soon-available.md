The release of KeyboardKit 9 is just around the corner, with many architectural changes and new features that will make KeyboardKit better than ever!

KeyboardKit 9 is a huge step forward for the library. It will clean up a lot of the codebase to make it easier to understand and use, and use a new styling architecture that is based on SwiftUI modifiers to make styling more powerful than ever before.

The layout engine is now even more flexible, and can render the iPad keyboard as an iPhone one when it's floating. More powerful features are also coming to the emoji keyboard, which will now support scrolling through categories and searching for emojis.

There will be a full-blown article to cover all changes and features when KeyboardKit 9 is released. Until then, please have a look at the [roadmap]({{page.roadmap}}) for remaining work, and the [list of completed tasks]({{page.roadmap-done}}) to get an idea what will come.

KeyboardKit 9 RC 1 will be out next week, then thoroughly tested before it's released. Make sure to give it a go once it's out, to ensure that the release is as stable as possible.

See you soon!
