After 6 months of KeyboardKit Pro development and new features, the license prices will be adjusted at October 31.

After the price change, a Basic license will be $500 and a Silver license $750. The Gold license will stay at $1000, making it the best value with all locales unlocked.

Due to this adjustment, Basic licenses have been extended with access to remote autocomplete. This change is already in effect in KeyboardKit 5.0, so you can start using it right away.

Previously purchased licenses will renew at the original price of purchase, so make sure to sign up before October 31 to get an amazing deal for the entire lifespan of your app.
