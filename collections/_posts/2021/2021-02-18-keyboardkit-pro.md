The KeyboardKit family has a new member - KeyboardKit Pro! It's a closed-source extension to the open-source library and unlocks pro features that are not available in the core library.


## Locales 

KeyboardKit Pro adds support for more locales, currently **English, German, Italian** and **Swedish**. 

Locale support includes locale-specific input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions, which means that you can easily change the entire locale of a system keyboard. 

More locales will be added over time. Create an issue or reach out if you have a suggestion for or need a specific locale.


## Autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro will include a fully functional autocomplete engine. This feature is being developed and is currently not available.


## Licensing

KeyboardKit Pro requires a Pro license, which can be requested [here](/pro). There are three available tiers, depending on your needs.


## Project Site

KeyboardKit Pro developer information and binaries are available at [the GitHub project site]({{site.github_repo_pro}}).
