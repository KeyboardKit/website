The KeyboardKit blog is now public, and with that we want post some updates regarding the project.


## Open source project

The [the open-source project]({{site.github_repo}}) has had a lot of traction lately, with a bunch of features being added, bugs fixed etc. If you haven't updated your apps to the latest versions, you really should.


## KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has been extended with a lot of new locales. At the time of writing, it supports:

* ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English (US - Default)
* ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° Danish
* ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± Dutch
* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ English (UK)
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡® Finnish
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· French
* ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª German
* ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italian
* ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norwegian
* ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spanish
* ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª Swedish

More locales will be added during autumn.


## App

We have paused development of the KeyboardKit app for iOS and iPadOS, to let the new betas stabilize. We can't wait to resume this work later this year.


## Client Projects

We have had several exciting client projects, where we have implemented KeyboardKit features and built entire apps. This has let us focus on improving KeyboardKit a great deal.


## KeyboardKit 5

WIth KeyboardKit 4, focus shifted from UIKit to SwiftUI. The next step will be to bump the library to 5.0, where all UIKit-specific things will be removed along with a lot of deprecated functionality.

You will still be able to use UIKit when creating custom keyboards with KeyboardKit, but the library will not include UIKit-specific views or extensions. We will happily link to any community-driven projects for this.

The 5.0 bump will happen later this autumn, probably in September.
