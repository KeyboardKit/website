KeyboardKit 5.3 is out. This version adds support for ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡± Albanian, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸ Icelandic and ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Polish and adds a bunch of new Pro and non-Pro features.

Adding support for the three languages above means that KeyboardKit continues to work towards the 5.x goal of supporting all European languages. More locales will follow in future minor versions.

This version also improves the license model in KeyboardKit Pro, which means that the license validation is a lot better and provides you with more information about your license.

This version also adds a behavior change, which is that when typing a single quote, the keyboard automatically switches back to the alphabetical keyboard, just like native iOS keyboards do.

This version also adds a lot more features and bug fixes. Please see the release notes for more information.
