The KeyboardKit 10 Beta is now available to developers! This test version lets you take KeyboardKit 10 for a test drive and provide early feedback and bug reports.

## üì¶ Project Changes

KeyboardKit 10 merges KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro into a single, unified SDK that now targets iOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, watchOS 10, and visionOS 1.

This means there will no longer be two separate KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro projects. Instead, the Pro features are integrated into the core framework, with the same license protection as before.

This provides a more cohesive developer experience, with a single SDK, and a single way to add and set up KeyboardKit. It also makes the SDK way easier to manage and will let us ship features faster.

A single, closed-source SDK will also enable us to serve enterprise customers better, as we can now add integrations directly into the core engine. We are excited about the possibilities this unlocks.

We strongly believe that going closed-source will make it easier to manage the project and to create new features and great documentation that will help everyone who use KeyboardKit.


## üìÑ KeyboardKit Pro License Changes

KeyboardKit 10 has a new license file format. All license file customers will get an updated file when the new version is released. Until then, you can [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) to get a new file.

KeyboardKit will no longer have licenses encoded into the SDK. This means that you will either need a license file or a Gumroad subscription license key.

Gumroad licenses will no longer parse locales from the purchase. Gumroad users must instead add the locales they want to use when setting up the library.


## üíø Installing KeyboardKit 10

KeyboardKit 10 is exclusively installed from the [main repository]({{site.urls.github}}), even if you use KeyboardKit Pro. You must also and change all `import KeyboardKitPro` to `import KeyboardKit`.

If you upgrade to KeyboardKit 10 from an earlier version, make sure to follow the guide below.


## üõ£Ô∏è Upgrading from KeyboardKit 9

Migrating from KeyboardKit 9 to KeyboardKit 10 should be straightforward. Just follow these steps:

* To upgrade from even older versions, see each major version upgrade guide.
* To upgrade from KeyboardKit 9.x to 10.x, first upgrade to KeyboardKit 9.9.
* Make sure to address all deprecation warnings (if any) before you proceed.
* You can now upgrade to KeyboardKit 10.0, using the new, unified framework.
* If you face breaking changes, see the breaking changes section at the end.
* If you get migration deprecation warnings during build, you must fix them.
* You are done upgrading when you have no more breaking changes or warnings.

If you are on KeyboardKit 8.x or earlier, we recommend that you follow the upgrade guide of the older version. Once you're on KeyboardKit 9, the steps above should work.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Warnings

Although most deprecated parts of the library have been removed in this major version, some still remain as migration warnings, to help you migrate from KeyboardKit 9.9.

Code that triggers these warnings will not work as expected, and are only there to guide you. These warnings will be removed in KeyboardKit 10.1.

The migration warning approach has been very appreciated in earlier major versions, and we are happy to provide these warnings as an extra help this time around as well.


## üìó Documentation

This online documentation is still built for KeyboardKit 9, but you can download the KeyboardKit 10 documentation from the [release page]({{page.release}}).


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Autocomplete

KeyboardKit 10 greatly improves the autocomplete service capabilities, and makes it a lot easier to integrate with remote services.

The `LocalAutocompleteService` is renamed to `StandardAutocompleteService`, and has new ways to use `RemotePredictionRequest`s to trigger remote predictions.

The `RemotePredictionRequest` is a renamed version of the now removed `NextWordPredictionRequest`. It can be used for all prediction operations, not just next word predictions.

The `.claude` and `.openAI` request builders are now generic, and can be used for any request, but have easy ways to use them for next word prediction.

The `NextWordPredictionRequestType`'s new `standardRequest(for:)` builder use the new `.claude` and `openAI` next word prediction prompts to create next word prediction requests.

Finally, the `.claude` remote prediction request builder uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` by default to let you keep using Claude after Sonnet 3.5 is discontinued.

Due to these many changes and improvements, the `RemoteAutocompleteService` is no longer needed and will be removed.


## üìã Clipboard

KeyboardKit 10 has a new `Clipboard` namespace with clipboard-related features to let users paste from the system clipboard and a collection of custom clips. 

<div class="grid col2">
    <span class="col2">
        <img src="{{page.assets}}clipboard-settings.jpg" />
    </span>
    <span class="col2">
        <img src="{{page.assets}}clipboard-keyboard.jpg" />
    </span>
</div>

There is a new `SettingsScreen` that can be used to manage clips in the main app, a `ClipsScreen` that can be used to select clips, and a `Keyboard` that can paste into the current app.


## üî§ Fonts

KeyboardKit 10 has a new `Fonts` namespace with font-related features that will let users type with different fonts than the standard system font. 

<div class="grid col2">
    <span class="col2">
        <img src="{{page.assets}}fonts-settings.jpg" />
    </span>
    <span class="col2">
        <img src="{{page.assets}}fonts-keyboard.jpg" />
    </span>
</div>

There is a new `SettingsScreen` that can be used to manage fonts in the main app. Selected fonts will by default be used by the `KeyboardView`.

Due to the market situation of custom font keyboards, this feature is exclusive to custom licenses. It is not part of the Gold license, and requires a special license.


## ‚ú® Features

Although KeyboardKit 10 mainly focuses on project structure, architecture and simplifications, there are a few new features.

First of all `DeviceType` has a `preferredKeyboardDeviceType`, which makes `KeyboardView` render better on macOS and tvOS, where it's now using the iPad design and layout.

Several views and features that were previously in KeyboardKit Pro are now open to everyone, such as `Feedback.Toggle` and `Keyboard.BottomRow`, and many `KeyboardLayout` customizations.

Finally `Keyboard.InputType` is a new type that separates the keyboard type from the input type. This makes KeyboardKit better at switching between different text fields.


## üí° Changes

Views now use environment injection instead of init injection for all observable contexts. This makes it a lot easier to use them, and will make it easier to change them as needed.

The `Keyboard.ButtonContent` no longer displays a locale name for space, since this is no longer in the native keyboard.

The `Keyboard.KeyboardType` has converted some keyboard types to input types. This makes it easier to switch input type wthout affecting the keyboard.

The `KeyboardLayout` now uses iPad Pro layouts on all iPad devices, and on macOS, tvOS & visionOS.

The `KeyboardView` has a fewer init arguments, which makes it a lot easier to use and customize. The final release may remove even a few more arguments.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 10 is a huge step forward for the library and for KeyboardKit as a product. Please give this new developer preview a try and let us know if you run into any bugs or problems.

For more info and to download the documentation, please see the [KeyboardKit 10 release notes]({{page.release}}). This page also contains a list of breaking changes that you should be aware of when updating.

We hope you will love using KeyboardKit 10.
