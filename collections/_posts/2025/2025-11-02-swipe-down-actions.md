KeyboardKit 10.1 will add secondary swipe down actions to the iPad keyboard. This is auto-enabled for all locales, but can be disabled with a new setting or by customizing the layout.

Swipe down actions let users access characters from another input set by swiping down on any key.

The alphabetic keyboard will for instance fetch its swipe down actions from the numeric keyboard:

while the numeric keyboard will fetch its actions from the symbolic keyboard, as long as they differ:

![Symbolic keyboard without swipe down actions]({{page.assets}}ipad-symbolic.jpg)

Note that the symbolic keyboard has no secondary actions. This is the same as the native keyboard.


## Conclusion

Swipe down actions is a since long requested feature. We are excited to add this to the 10.1 release, which will be out later in November.
