We're excited to announce a significant evolution to KeyboardKit, that will drastically improve your development experience, and accelerate our ability to deliver powerful keyboard solutions.

## The Journey So Far

KeyboardKit has grown tremendously since its inception almost 10 year ago, evolving from a small library into a powerful product that serves many companies and developers worldwide. 

Throughout this journey, we have learned invaluable lessons about what works, what doesn't, and most importantly, what our community needs to build exceptional keyboard experiences.

Today, we're ready to announce the next major step forward.

## Introducing the Unified KeyboardKit SDK

We're consolidating our two SDKs platform into a single, unified SDK that contains the best of both worlds: free, core features and powerful pro features, all under one roof.

This step represents months of careful planning and considerations, with the overarching goal of making KeyboardKit the best possible tool for building custom keyboard extensions.

## What This Means for You (and for Us)

### üéØ **Simplified Integration**

KeyboardKit will no longer be shipped as two separate packages - KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro. Instead, there will only be a single KeyboardKit SDK, with Pro features added to it.

With the unified SDK, you'll have:

- **One package to rule them all**: A single Swift package that includes everything you need.
- **No need for package switching**: You don't have to switch to another package when you go pro.
- **Elimination of integration complexity**: You don't have to rewrite your code when you go pro.

### üìö **Dramatically Improved Documentation**

Another significant improvement you'll notice is that the documentation will be greatly improved.

Up until now, we have had to build out two separate documentations, and add placeholders to the open-source project to be able to mention Pro features. With a single library, is no longer needed.

The unified SDK approach will result in:

- **Complete, unified documentation**: Every feature, from basic to pro, documented in one place.
- **No more placeholders**: The documentation will no longer have to work around missing pieces.
- **Consistent examples**: Code examples will become cleaner, since there will only be a single SDK.
- **Better discoverability**: Exploring and comparing basic & pro features will become a lot easier.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Enhanced Product Development**

The technical benefits of this consolidation extend beyond convenience. We will now be able to:

- **Develop faster**: No more synchronization complexities between repositories.
- **Design better**: With everything under one roof, the system design will become better.
- **Refactor more reliably**: With a single library, code refactoring becomes more robust.
- **Fix issues faster**: Issues and feature requests can be addressed without coordination overhead.


## Migration Made Easy

We understand that changes like this can be disruptive, which is why we've designed the migration process to be as smooth as possible.

### **One Package**

If you currently use the KeyboardKit package, very little will change. You will be able to keep using the same package, although you will probably have to change how you link it.

If you use KeyboardKit Pro, you will just have to switch back to the KeyboardKit package. The Pro package will be discontinued, but kept around for Pro users who still haven't migrated.

### **Familiar API**

The APIs you know and love will remain largely unchanged. The main difference is that everything will now be available through a single import and package.

### **Comprehensive Migration Guide**

We'll provide detailed migration documentation that includes step-by-step instructions for updating your packages and apps, with code examples, blog posts and other resources.


## Pricing and Access Remain Unchanged

It's important to note that this technical evolution doesn't affect our commitment to accessibility:

- **Free tier remains**: All basic features continue to be available at no cost.
- **Pro pricing stays the same**: Advanced features maintain their current pricing structure.
- **Same great value**: You're getting more convenience and better integration for the same price.


## Timeline

The SDK unification will be part of KeyboardKit 10, which will aim to release in the end of Q3. This major version will follow the same well-organized release structure as previous versions.


## Community and Support

This transition represents our commitment to the KeyboardKit community. We're not just changing how we organize code; we're drastically improving the library based on your feedback.


## Conclusion

This evolution represents more than a technical change - it's a big improvement to KeyboardKit and the many companies and developers who rely on it. 

By unifying the KeyboardKit SDKs, we're creating a foundation that will support innovation, stability, and a great user experiences for years to come.

The future of KeyboardKit is unified, powerful, and designed around your success. We can't wait to see what you'll think of it.
