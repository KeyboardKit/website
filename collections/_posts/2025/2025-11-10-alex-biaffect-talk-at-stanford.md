Alex Leow from BiAffect just gave a talk at Stanford, on how the BiAffect keyboard can track mental health through the collection and analysis of a person's typing profile.

When we started working on KeyboardKit 10 years ago, we were intrigued by the complex challenge of replicating the native iOS keyboard. We have now had the luxury of working on it for many years, and have gotten to meet many amazing people and companies along the way.

One such person is Alex and her team at BiAffect, who created a custom keyboard to enable mental health research through the analysis of a person's typing profile. The way in which a person types lets BiAffect detect if a person is entering or already in a bipolar episode. This makes it possible to get early help, and to get a deeper understanding on illness patterns and behaviors.

Mental health is one of many very exciting areas where a custom keyboard is a critical enabler, and BiAffect goes way beyond what we envisioned when we started working on KeyboardKit.
