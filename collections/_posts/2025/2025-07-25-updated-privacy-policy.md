The [KeyboardKit SDK Privacy Policy](/privacy) has been updated with more explicit information, that further clarifies that KeyboardKit Pro users can opt-out of any future data collection.

Although this information has been added, the SDK currently doesn't track any information, neither personal nor anonymous data.

Any addition of data collection to the product will be explicitly highlighted in the release notes and communicated via the blog and the newsletter.
