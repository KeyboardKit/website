The official [KeyboardKit subreddit]({{site.urls.reddit}}) has just been launched. We're excited to launch this community for developers and enthusiasts using the KeyboardKit SDK and the KeyboardKit app!

## Why Reddit?

The KeyboardKit Discord has previously been where KeyboardKit Pro customers have been able to discuss with the KeyboardKit team and other developers who are using the SDK.

A big drawback with Discord is however that you must check in to not miss anything. All discussions are also eventually lost to the wind, increasingly further up in an ever growing history.

We hope that the subreddit will be a better place for asynchronous discussions, and that the open nature of Reddit will allow discussions to surface in search engines and AI tools.

So whether you want to discuss the SDK or the app, or you just want to browse discussions or find more information, [join the official KeyboardKit subreddit today!]({{site.urls.reddit}})


## What about Discord?

The Discord will still be around, but it will be reserved for custom license customers with a higher support level in their agreements.

The Discord link will be removed from the Gumroad purchase information. That information will instead link to the subreddit.


## What now?

We can't wait to see you in the [official KeyboardKit subreddit]({{site.urls.reddit}})! Join today and let's build a great, discoverable community together.
