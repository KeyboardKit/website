## Why Software Escrow Matters to Enterprises

Software escrow services act as a critical insurance policy for businesses that rely on closed-source software. With a proper escrow service agreement in place, companies will be able to access source code, documentation, and build instructions, to keep their software operational, in case the licensor faces business-critical events, such as bankrupcy.

For large-scale applications, this level of protection isn't just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's a critical component of responsible business continuity planning. Software escrow provides risk management that helps satisfy both internal security requirements and external compliance standards. 

Many enterprises require escrow agreements for significant software partnerships, and recognizes them as a safeguard in today's digital business environment. KeyboardKit Pro is happy to now offer these services as part of the [Enterprise Tier](/pro), to keep our enterprise customers safe.


## Secure Your KeyboardKit Pro-Based Apps Today

KeyboardKit Pro's software escrow agreement guarantees that customers will be able to access the library source code, in case the owner company experiences business disruptions, like bankrupcy.

If this would happen, enterprise customers will be able to get in contact with an 3rd party, to access the KeyboardKit Pro source code, and use that source code to keep their products operational. The source code can be added as a local Swift Package, and requires no integration changes.

KeyboardKit is committed to provide our enterprise customers with enterprise-grade reliability and transparency. We recognize that when you choose to use KeyboardKit Pro for your keyboard-based features, you're making a strategic decision that deserves proper protection.
