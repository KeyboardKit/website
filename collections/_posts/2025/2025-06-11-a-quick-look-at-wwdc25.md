Apple's WWDC 2025 is on, with many news and updates, including a brand new unified design for all of Apple's platforms, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and CarPlay.

## Liquid Glass

The theme of the year is **Liquid Glass**, where many old design conventions are replaced with new kinds of glass panels, and a UI that transforms and morphs as you use your device.

However, this first beta is clearly not done. While apps like Maps get wonderful new Liquid Glass powered sheets, the keyboard is clearly not done yet.

This is probably why there were so few glimpses of the keyboard in the WWDC and the Platforms State of the Union keynotes.

Regardless, we will obviously have to make some design changes to the KeyboardKit keyboard this year, which is why we are excited to have the new design tools out in KeyboardKit 9.5.

## Intelligence(?)

Another big thing this year is the extended support for Apple Intelligence, where developers will be able to tap into local intelligence with the Foundation Models Framework.

Apple demonstrates some of its use, with local translations, language tools, etc. We are very excited for what this could mean for keyboards and will explore this asap.

It would be very unfortunate if these new models are restricted for use in the main app target only, so we're keeping our fingers crossed as Xcode is downloading this new support.

Regardless, we still need alternatives to Apple Intelligence, since this feature is restricted to iPhone 15 Pro and later, and only works with a few languages. But the future looks bright.


## Conclusion

The biggest stand out feature in this years' update is the Liquid Glass redesign, which will be fully supported in KeyboardKit 10.0.

Other than that, we're keeping our fingers crossed for a year of amazing intelligence, and that the new language features will be available to keyboard extensions as well.
