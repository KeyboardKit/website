KeyboardKit 9.7 is out! This version reverts some previous keyboard action deprecations, adds new emoji features, and fixes some bugs.

## Reverted Deprecations

After some developer feedback, this update reverts some deprecations and moves standard value builders back to the `KeyboardAction` type.

The last versions move standard value builders from `KeyboardAction` to each value type. So instead of `KeyboardAction.standardButtonStyle(for:)` the standard `Keyboard.ButtonStyle` builder was moved to `Keyboard.ButtonStyle` and renamed to `standard(for:context:)`.

The idea with this was to attach standard value builders to each value type, to make them easier to find and to enable shorthands, where you could just return `.standard(...)` for each type. 

However, this made it a lot harder to work with keyboard styling, since the varioys parts that make up a complete `Keyboard.ButtonStyle` got scattered throughout the library. By moving the builders back to `KeyboardAction`, all value builders are grouped together, which makes it a lot easier to work with style customizations.


## Emoji Utilities

KeyboardKit 9.7 adds new `EmojiContext` and `EmojiSettings` types, which are used by the standard action handler to register tapped emojis, and the `EmojiKeyboard` to display the last used skin tone.

## Autocomplete Toolbar Improvements

KeyboardKit 9.7 improves the `Autocomplete.ToolbarItem` ny automatically wrapping it in a scroll view if it's too long to fit the item's bounding area.

The scroll view will add a gradient mask to fade the edges and indigate that the text can be scrolled.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 9.7 simplifies action style customizations, adds new emoji capabilities, and improves the emoji keyboard and autocomplete toolbar.
