KeyboardKit 9.1 is out, with many updates! 🚀 Let's take a look the new features, adjustments and bug fixes that this version brings to KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro.

## Important Migration Changes

This version removes the KeyboardKit 8 migration support! Migrate to the last 9.0 version before upgrading from KeyboardKit 8 to 9.1 or later, to ensure a smooth transition.


## Easier to set up keyboard app information

This version makes it easier to set up a `KeyboardApp` for your app, by removing the need to specify a `bundleId`. It is no longer used internally, so the app doesn't need it anymore.


## Support for keyboard docking

This version makes it possible to dock your keyboard to the leading or trailing edge of the screen, to simplify one handed typing on iPhone.

To make this work, the `Keyboard.Settings` class has a new, auto-persisted `keyboardDockEdge` setting, that can be set to any horizontal edge to enable docking.

KeyboardKit Pro 9.2 will add a new dock section to the `KeyboardApp.SettingsScreen`, which means that you will not have to write any code to support this feature.


## Add a locale switcher to the spacebar

This version makes it possible to add a locale switcher to the trailing edge of the spacebar. This lets you mimic the iOS 18 multi-locale mode, but with a different behavior.

To make this work, `Keyboard.SpaceLongPressBehavior` has a new `.moveInputCursorWithLocaleSwitcher`, which can be used to use the spacebar to move the input cursor AND switch locale.

KeyboardKit Pro 9.2 will move `spaceLongPressBehavior` from `KeyboardContext` to `Keyboard.Settings`, and convert this to an auto-persisted user setting. 

KeyboardKit Pro 9.2 will also add a new section to the `KeyboardApp.SettingsScreen`, which means that you will not have to write any code to support this feature.


## Emoji keyboard improvements

The KeyboardKit Pro `EmojiKeyboard` has been improved, and now renders even better on different device types. It also uses environment injected styles to greater extent.

From now on, `KeyboardView` will automatically adjust the emoji keyboard style to add an additional row if an input toolbar is added. You no longer have to do this yourself.

Finally, all `Emoji` and `Emoji.Category` values have been localized in Spanish. This will improve emoji searches in Spanish, and make the keyboard display the Spanish titles.


## URL and e-mail keyboard improvements

The iPhone and iPad-specific layout services will now render the `.email` and `.url` keyboard types better, by adjusting the keys and key size for these keyboard types.


## Model improvements

Even though KeyboardKit still uses Swift 5.9, it starts preparing for the future Swift 6 transition by making its data models conform to more protocols, like `Codable` and `Sendable`.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 9.1 contains many new features and adjustments that makes KeyboardKit even more capable. For more info, see the [release]({{page.release}}) or [KeyboardKit Pro release]({{page.release-pro}}).
