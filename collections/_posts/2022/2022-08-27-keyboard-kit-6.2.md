KeyboardKit 6.2 is out, with even more improvements made to the standard KeyboardKit Pro autocomplete provider.


## Casing

The standard autocomplete provider's case handling has been improved further, and will handle suggestions differently depending on where they come from. Suggestions from your contacts will be prioritized lower than locale-specific ones.


## Predictions

The standard autocomplete provider has been extended with (limited) prediction capabilities. Although these will not always show up, typing a sentence will now sometimes suggest words where you would never receive updates in previous versions.


## Conclusion

KeyboardKit 6.2 improves autocomplete-based typing quite a bit, making typing on a pro keyboard a lot nicer than before.
