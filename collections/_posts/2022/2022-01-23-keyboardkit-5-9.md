KeyboardKit 5.9 is out! ğŸš€ It adds support for 11 new locales and makes the library build on more platforms.


## New locales

KeyboardKit 5.8 adds support for 11 new keyboards locales:

* ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¬ Bulgarian
* ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡© Catalan
* ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡´ Faroese
* ğŸ‡µğŸ‡­ Filipino
* ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡ª Georgian
* ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡° Macedonian
* ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¹ Maltese
* ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡³ Mongolian
* ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸ Serbian
* ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡¸ Serbian (Latin)
* ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° Slovak

This work continued the efforts of 5.8 to improve the iPhone and iPad layout engines further and make them easier to adapt.

As a result, the iPad layout is now greatly improved compared to earlier versions, with all Pro keyboards now behaving very close to their native counterparts.

With KeyboardKit Pro now able to generate system keyboards with almost pixel perfection, supporting even more locales will be a lot easier.

KeyboardKit 6 will aim to take things even further and may even start to implement layouts for minor languages that lack native iOS keyboards.


## Platform support

Another big change in this version is that KeyboardKit now supports watchOS and tvOS as well.

KeyboardKit 6.0 will extend this support to macOS, which means that KeyboardKit will soon support all major Apple platforms.
