KeyboardKit 5.7 is out! ðŸš€ It adds support for ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¾ Belarusian, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ Czech and ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ Romanian, adjust emoji keyboard styles on iPad and much more.

To explain what adding new locales mean, KeyboardKit adds new keyboard locales as well as localized strings, after which KeyboardKit Pro adds full system keyboard support for all new locales. This means that with KeyboardKit, you get access to the locales and their localized content, while KeyboardKit Pro lets you create system keyboards for the locales.

KeyboardKit 5.7 also adjusts the emoji keyboard design on iPad, making the previously quite small emojis larger, to look more like the native emoji keyboards. Note that the emoji keyboard views are fully customizable and that this adjustment just tweaks the standard styles for iPad and iPad Pro, portrait and landscape.

KeyboardKit 5.7 also adds more String and Character utils for detecting and handling emojis, and adds an accidentally missing emoji.
