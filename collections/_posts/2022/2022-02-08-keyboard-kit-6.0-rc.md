Work on KeyboardKit 6.0 has been completed. The release candidate will be available for testing until the end of the week. If no one reports anything strange with this release candidate, KeyboardKit 6.0 will be released on February 13.

Some of the major changes in KeyboardKit 6.0 is that a lot of old, deprecated code has been removed and that KeyboardKit Pro is now standalone. If you are using KeyboardKit Pro, you should take this week and give the new rc a good try.
