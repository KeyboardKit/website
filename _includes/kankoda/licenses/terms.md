## License Details

A license is valid for one product, defined by the bundle ID that is provided at the time of purchase.


### Activation

A license is activated and can be used immediately after purchase, using the unique license key that can be found in the license purchase confirmation.


### Validation

All licenses, except yearly Gold licenses, require server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but the product must perform regular server validation.


### Additions

Additional products can be added to a license at a 50% discount per product. This discount applies as long as the original license is active. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) to add more products.


### Adjustments

The purchase information can't be changed after a purchase is made, but can be overridden with a new version, if needed. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) to adjust or correct any information.


### Expiration

A license expires when its subscription ends. This will stop the related product from being able to use {{ product }} in development and production.



## Free Trial

All licenses include a free trial with unlimited access to all the features in the selected tier. The trial will automatically convert to a paid plan if it's not cancelled.



## Refunds

The free trial can be cancelled at any time. No refunds will be approved after the free trial ends. An active license subscription can be cancelled at any time, to stop it from being renewed.



## Technical Information

{{ product }} targets the current major OS version for its supported platforms, and two major versions back (one for macOS). Support is only removed in a major version bump.

{{ product }} is built with the latest version of Xcode, but offers on-demand builds for the last major version, up to three months after the latest major version was released. 


## Feature Disclaimer

SDK features may stop working in any future platform update, due to changes in the operating system, hardware or platform capabilities, etc.

Features that stop working due to these kind of changes may be removed without replacement or compensation, since required capabilities may no longer be available.
