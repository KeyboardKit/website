## License Details

The license is valid for one product, as defined by the bundle IDs that is provided during purchase.


### License Activation

A license that is purchased through the online shop is activated and can be used immediately after purchase, using the unique license key that is found in the purchase confirmation.

Custom & Enterprise licenses are activated once an agreement is signed and the payment has been received, and will be valid in a new software version for one calendar year from the release date.


### License Validation

All licenses require server validation, except yearly Gold, Custom & Enterprise licenses. The result is cached to handle connectivity loss, but the product must perform regular server validation.

Some application types, like keyboard extensions, require Full Access to perform server validation.


### License Adjustments

The purchase information can't be changed after a purchase is made, but can be overridden with a new software version, if needed. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) to adjust or correct any information.


### License Additions

Additional products can be added to a license at a 50% discount per product. This discount applies as long as the original license is active. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) for more information.


### License Expiration

A license expires when the subscription or agreement ends. This will stop the product from being able to use the {{product}} SDK in both development and production.


### License Renewal

A license that is purchased through the online shop is automatically renewed, unless it's terminated by either part. Custom & Enterprise licenses are manually renewed as specified by the agreement.

Renewed subscriptions will not see a price increase of more than 25% compared to the previous subscription period. Expired subscriptions will be re-activated at the current listing price.



## Free Trial

All licenses include a free trial with unlimited access to all the features in the selected tier. The trial will automatically convert to a paid plan if it's not cancelled.



## Software Deliverable

The software deliverable includes:

* A binary distribution of the software, for use on iOS.
* A license key that can be used to activate the software.
* A demo application with common use-cases and examples.
* Online documentation for the latest version of the software.

A license that is purchased through the online shop gets access to a general license agreement. Custom & Enterprise licenses will receive a custom license agreement with specific information.



## Software Updates

During the subscription period, the product will be able to access all updates to {{product}} that are released.



## Bug Fixes

Bug fixes will be dealt with in a reasonable timeframe andare merged into the software for use by all other licensees. If a bug fix is required urgently, or if it involves company-specific treatment or considerations, Kankoda may, at its discretion, require additional payment to prioritize the work.



## Feature Requests

Feature requests are accepted and entered into the standard internal processes for consideration for
a future release. If a feature is required urgently, or if it involves company-specific treatment or considerations, Kankoda may, at its discretion, require additional payment to prioritize the work.



## Refunds

The free trial can be cancelled at any time. No refunds will be approved after the free trial ends. An active license subscription can be cancelled at any time, to stop it from being renewed.



## Technical Information

{{ product }} targets the current major OS version for the supported platforms, and two major versions back (one for macOS). Support for older versions is only removed in a major version bump.

The regular {{ product }} release is built for iOS only, but multi-platform support can be added in a custom license agreement.

{{ product }} offers on-demand builds for the last major version of Xcode, up to three months after the latest major version of Xcode was released. 


## Feature Disclaimer

SDK features may stop working in any future update of the operating system, hardware or platform, etc. that remove or alter functionality that is required by the feature.

Features that stop working due to mentioned changes may be removed without any replacement or compensation of any kind, since required capabilities may no longer be available.


## Warranty

Kankoda provides the software without warranty, and accepts no liability for any damage caused. All end-user support, including problems derived from the software, are the sole responsibility of the licensee.

In no event will Kankoda be held liable for any special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages (including loss of use, data, business or profits) or for the cost of procuring substitute products or services arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the use, operation or performance of the software or any services, whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (incl. negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and enter or not Kankoda has been advised of such loss or damage. The parties have agreed that these limitations will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
