<h2>About this model</h2>

<p>The thought with this model is to cap on annual proceeds, so that the license revenue grows as my customers start making more money.</p>

<p>One big drawback with this is that the proceeds are just estimated numbers. It's also another factor that may have to be tweaked over time, with existing customers becoming affected or confused.</p>

<p>Customers may also be confused by the number and be scared off. It may also be strange to cap on both proceeds and features.</p>
