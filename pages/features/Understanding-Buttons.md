description: KeyboardKit can style any view as a keyboard button.
---


KeyboardKit has a few general buttons that can be used to mimic native keyboard buttons. It doesn't require you to use the views and buttons in the library, but it can help speed up development.



## Keyboard Button

The ``KeyboardButton`` namespace defines a couple of button types that help you mimic native keyboard buttons:

- ``KeyboardButton.Button`` renders actions and custom view as a keyboard button.
- ``KeyboardButton.Content`` renders the keyboard button content for an action.
- ``KeyboardButton.Key`` renders a keyboard button key shape.
- ``KeyboardButton.Shadow`` renders a keyboard button bottom shadow.
- ``KeyboardButton.SpaceContent`` renders space-specific keyboard button content.
- ``KeyboardButton.Title`` renders a keyboard button title.

You can also use the `.keyboardButton` view modifier to convert any view to a keyboard button.



## Next Keyboard Button

The ``NextKeyboardButton`` can be used to trigger the system's keyboard switcher function, which selects the next keyboard when tapped and shows a keyboard menu when long pressed. 

This button requires a ``KeyboardInputViewController``. KeyboardKit will by default use the current controller, but you can use a custom controller if you want.  

KeyboardKit will by default map the ``.nextKeyboard`` action to this button type.
