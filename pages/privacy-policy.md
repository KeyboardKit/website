# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for the KeyboardKit iOS app (hereby referred to as "the app"). 

This policy explains how we collect and use data in the app.

Whenever this policy mentions "personal data", it refers to data that directly or indirectly may be used to identify you as an individual. Whenever this policy mentions "anonymous data", it refer to data that can not be used to identify you as an individual.

This policy may be updated when new features are added to the app. Whenever that happens, we will mention it in the release notes, so that you have the chance to review the updated policy before installing the update.

The app collects data when you use it to send us suggestions, feedback or error reports as e-mails. It may also collect anonymous usage data, e.g. how often it is used.


## How data is used

The usage data is used to improve the app. Suggestions, feedback and error reports sent by users are deleted when they are no longer relevant, e.g. when answered or implemented.
