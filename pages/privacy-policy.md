# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for the {{page.app-name}} iOS app (hereby referred to as "the app"). The policy explains how the app collects and shares data.

Whenever this policy mentions "personal data", it refers to data that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you as an individual. This can include information such as your first and last name, e-mail, home address etc. 

Whenever this policy mentions "anonymous data", it refers to data that can not be used to identify you as an individual. This can include information such as the tracking of screen views and button taps, the logging of device-specific information, such as screen size etc.

Whenever this policy mentions "collecting data", it refers to the act of gathering and persisting data for the purpose of data analysis, bug fixes, crash reporting etc. Data is most often generated and collected without any related action from your side. For instance, if the app crashes, it may be because of a bug in the app that was triggered by an action that you performed, while your intention was not to generate data.

Whenever this policy mentions "handling data", it refers to handling data that you produce as a direct result of an action explicit to the generated data. This may include, but is not limited to, e-mails that you send from the app, text that you enter when you create items in the app etc.

This policy may be updated when new features are added to the app. Whenever this happens, it will be mentioned in the release notes, so that you have the chance to review the updated policy before installing the update.
