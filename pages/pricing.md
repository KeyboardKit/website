Visit the [project site]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for more information.

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from the [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) e-shop <!--[Lemon Squeezy]({{site.lemon_url}})-->. [Reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) if you want to include any add-ons, or if you have another preferred method of payment or invoicing.

The tiers above are aimed at indie developers, startups and small businesses. For enterprises and organizations with more than $1M USD in annual proceeds, please [reach out for a custom plan](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License).


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using KeyboardKit Pro. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Additional bundle IDs and development licenses can be added at a **50% discount**. A development license can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production.

By signing up for a license, you acknowledge and approve the info and terms listed on [this page](/pro/terms-and-conditions).


## License activation

After purchasing a license, you will receive a welcome e-mail with your license key once the license has been activated, typically **within 48 hours**.

If we are unable to activate your license within this time, we will get in touch with you to explain the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before your license has been activated.

The license period starts when the license is activated, not at the time of purchase. This means that the time it takes to activate your license doesn't affect the time you'll have to use it.
