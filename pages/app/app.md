---

The official [KeyboardKit app for iOS and iPadOS]({{site.appstore_url}}) lets you create custom keyboards directly on an iPhone or iPad, without writing a single line of code.

The app uses [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) to support all [{{site.locale_count}} locales](/locales) and features like autocomplete, dictation, emoji skintones, themes, etc. 

The app comes with many pre-defined themes from the [KeyboardKit Pro theme engine](/themes) and also lets you create completely custom themes that you can share with others.
