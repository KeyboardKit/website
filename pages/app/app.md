description: The KeyboardKit app lets you create custom keyboards for iOS and iPadOS. It supports a bunch of features and lets you create completely custom themes.
---

The [KeyboardKit app]({{site.urls.appstore}}) lets you use a KeyboardKit directly on your iPhone or iPad. You can use all [{{site.locales.count}} supported locales](/locales), add more keys to the keyboard, resize keys, customize the design, etc.

The KeyboardKit app uses [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) to support many [pro](/pro) features. It comes with many pre-defined [themes](/pro/themes) and lets you create custom themes that you can share with others.
