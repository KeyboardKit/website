description: The KeyboardKit Pro trial lets you try all Gold tier features before purchasing.
---

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) requires a commercial license, but you can try out all the Gold tier features with the free trial version before deciding to buy.

The trial version requires that you set up your app and keyboard extension with a certain bundle ID and use a trial license key when setting up KeyboardKit Pro. You will not be able to send the app to the App Store while using the trial version.

Please [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20Trial%20Version) with a little information about your company and/or app if you want to try out the trial version.


## Demo App

You can try many of the Gold features without a trial version and without having to write a single line of code. Just visit the [GitHub project website]({{site.github_url_pro}}) to try out the demo app that is pre-configured with a Gold license.


## KeyboardKit App

You can also try out many of the Gold features by downloading the [KeyboardKit app]({{site.appstore_url}}) from the App Store. It's a bit dated, but will soon be updated with the latest and greatest technologies.
