## About

KeyboardKit is an open-source library that can be used to build your own custom keyboards for iOS and iPadOS, using technologies like Swift and SwiftUI.

KeyboardKit extends your extension with powerful features that can be used to create keyboards that mimic native iOS keyboards as well as completely custom keyboards.

Check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo}}) for more information about the library, the features it provides and how to use it in your own apps.


## Locales

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>50</b> locales:

{% include locales.html %}

This support includes locale information and localized strings. For completely localized system keyboards, input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions, [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has you covered.


## Community

KeyboardKit is open-source, which means that it's community-driven. Anyone can contribute to the project, create issues and submit PRs that you think can make it better.


## Support

KeyboardKit is open-source and completely free, but any financial support is greatly appreciated to keep the project going.

You can support KeyboardKit by sponsoring [the GitHub project]({{page.sponsors}}) and signing up for a [Pro](/pro) license. You are also welcome to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Support) for paid consultation.
