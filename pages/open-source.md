## About

KeyboardKit is an open-source library that can be used to build your own custom keyboards, using technologies like **Swift** and **SwiftUI**.

KeyboardKit makes it easy to create keyboards that mimic the native stock iOS keyboards, as well as completely custom keyboards. It also provides keyboard-specific functionality for macOS, tvOS and watchOS.

Check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo}}) for more information about the library, the features it provides and how to use it in your own apps. There are also demo apps that you can use to try the library.


## Community

KeyboardKit is open-source, which means that it's community-driven. Anyone can contribute to the project, create issues and submit PRs that you think can make it better.


## Support

KeyboardKit is open-source and completely free, but any financial support is greatly appreciated to keep the project going.

You can support KeyboardKit by sponsoring [the GitHub project]({{page.sponsors}}), upgrading to [Pro](/pro) or paying for support and consultation. Please [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Support) for more information.
