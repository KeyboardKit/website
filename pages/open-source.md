KeyboardKit is an open-source library that can be used to build your own custom keyboards for iOS and iPadOS, using technologies like Swift, SwiftUI and UIKit. 

KeyboardKit can be used to create keyboards that mimic Apple's native keyboards, with alphabetic, numeric and symbolic inputs, emojis etc. as well as entirely custom keyboards.
