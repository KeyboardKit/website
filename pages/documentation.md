description: KeyboardKit Online Documentation
---

The online KeyboardKit [documentation]({{site.urls.docs}}) has a getting-started guide, articles, code samples & type documentation for all available features.

To demonstrate things that the documentation can't visualize, the [GitHub repository]({{site.urls.github}}) has a demo app with code samples that shows you how to set up and configure an app and its keyboard. 

You can also download the [KeyboardKit app]({{site.urls.appstore}}) from the App Store to test many of the core and pro features that the SDK provides. This lets you try KeyboardKit without having to write any code.

Make sure to [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) if you find that the documentation lacks critical information that you need.
