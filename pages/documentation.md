description: KeyboardKit provides an extensive online documentation.
---

KeyboardKit provides an [online documentation]({{site.urls.docs}}) with a getting-started guide, as well as articles and type documentation for all features in the SDK.

The [KeyboardKit Pro documentation]({{site.urls.docs_pro}}) contains Pro-specific documentation for types and features that only exist in the Pro SDK.

Since the documentation may lack code examples on certain things that you need, the [open-source code repository]({{site.urls.github}}) has a demo app with code samples.

You can also download the [KeyboardKit app]({{site.urls.appstore}}) from the App Store, to see how it implements certain features. Most features in this app is available in [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro).

Make sure to [reach out]({{site.urls.email}}) if you find that the documentation lacks critical information that you need.
