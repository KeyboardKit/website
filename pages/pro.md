{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses are purchased using your preferred method of payment (Bank Transfer, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit License) and we'll discuss your needs.


## License Information

Licenses are valid for **one year**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.

Licenses are valid for **one app** and keyboard extension. Additional apps can be added to a license at a 50% discount per additional app.

Gold licenses can be extended to support **tvOS**, **watchOS** and **macOS**. Additional platforms can be added to a license at a 50% discount per additional platform.


## Features

### Locale-specific features

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks locale-specific features, including localized system keyboards, input sets and callout actions.

This means that with KeyboardKit Pro, you can create a system keyboard in any locale that your license includes with a single line of code.


### Local autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a local autocomplete engine that provides suggestions as the user types. This engine is currently not predictable.

Have a look at the demo app in the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo}}) to see local autocomplete in action.


### Remote autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a remote autocomplete engine that lets you connect your keyboard to any remote autocomplete API or web service.

Remote autocomplete makes it possible to provide more powerful suggestions and to adjust the autocomplete without having to ship new versions of the app.


### Additional Views

KeyboardKit Pro adds a bunch of additional views, such as app templates, toolbars etc. Have a look at the documentation for more information.
