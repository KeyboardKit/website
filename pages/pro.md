KeyboardKit Pro is a license-based extension that unlocks [{% include locales/count.html %} locales](/locales) and lets you create localized system keyboards with just a few lines of code. It also unlocks powerful additional pro features.

KeyboardKit Pro requires a license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from for individuals, startups and small business. [Contact us for Enterprise and Educational needs](mailto:{{site.email}}).

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or [over e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) using your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). You can add your company information and VAT number directly on Gumroad. 


## Features

Visit [GitHub]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, sample code, online documentation, articles, a demo app etc.

Note that local autocomplete uses on-device technologies that may not be available for all locales, and that the provided suggestions are not predictable nor as advanced as the native ones. You can evaulate the local autocomplete result for all locales in the demo app, to see if it meets your needs.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using KeyboardKit Pro. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

After your purchase has been registered, you will receive a receipt and a license key. The key will be added to a new version of KeyboardKit Pro, which is typically released within 48 hours.

If we are unable to create a new version within 48 hours, you will be informed about the reason for the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before your license has been activated.


## Technical information

KeyboardKit targets the current iOS version and at least two major versions back. This means that when **iOS 17** is released, it may drop support for **iOS 14**, but only in a major version bump. 

KeyboardKit Pro will be built for the previous major version of Xcode for at least 3 months after a new major version has been released. After that, you must use the latest major version.
