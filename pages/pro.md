## About

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks {% include locales/count.html %} locales, including localized input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions. It lets you create a fully localized system keyboard with a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks local and remote autocomplete, emoji skintone support, additional views etc., and lets you read all text content from the text document. Visit the [GitHub repo]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, documentation, a demo application etc.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just tap the purchase buttons above or [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Autocomplete

Local autocomplete uses on-device capabilities to provide suggestions as the user types. It doesn't work with all locales, so make sure to try the demo app to verify if it would work for your use case.
