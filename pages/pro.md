KeyboardKit is <a href="/open-source">open-source</a> and free, but you can upgrade to KeyboardKit Pro to unlock additional features that take your keyboard to the next level. [Visit the KeyboardKit Pro project site]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, documentation etc.

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}})<!--[Lemon Squeezy]({{site.lemon_url}})--> or [over e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) using your preferred payment method. You can add your company information and VAT number when purchasing.


## Features

Note that local autocomplete uses on-device technologies that may not be available for all locales. You can evaulate it for all locales in the demo app, to see if it meets your needs before purchasing.

Dictation is a brand new feature that is currently in BETA. It may need more adjustments before it performs well enough for production use. Since it requires some setup, we are preparing an App Store app that shows you how it behaves. Do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Dictation) for a live demo over a video call.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using KeyboardKit Pro. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Higher tiers can add **additional bundles** (e.g. a second keyboard extensions) and **test licenses** (e.g. test app versions) at a discounted price. A test license must never be used in production and can't be converted to a production license.

Some Pro features make use of platform tweaks that can stop working in any future platform updates. If a feature stops working due to changes in the platform, the feature may be removed without any replacement or license adjustment.


## License activation

You will receive an email with a license agreement when your license has been activated. The license period starts when the license is activated, not at purchase.

If we are unable to activate your license within 48 hours after purchase, we will try to get in touch regarding the reason for the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before your license has been activated.


## Technical information

KeyboardKit Pro targets the current iOS version and two major versions back. Support for older iOS versions will only be removed in a major version bump.

KeyboardKit Pro is built with the previous version of Xcode up to 3 months after a new major version is released. After that, you must use the latest major version of Xcode to be able to use KeyboardKit Pro.
