## About

KeyboardKit Pro extends KeyboardKit with 60 localized input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions, as well as on-device and remote autocomplete engines, emoji skintones, additional views, the possibility to read the full text from the proxy, etc.

KeyboardKit Pro lets you create a fully localized system keyboard with a single line of code and can elevate your keyboard with Pro features. Check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for more information.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from Gumroad or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Autocomplete

Note that local autocomplete will not work with all 60 locales. Make sure to try the demo app before you buy to verify that everything works as needed.


## Demo app

If you want to try KeyboardKit Pro before you sign up for a Pro license, there is a demo app in both the [main]({{site.github_url}}) and the [Pro]({{site.github_url_pro}}) repositories, that shows you how to set up KeyboardKit Pro.

The KeyboardKit Pro demo lets you try out all localized keyboards, adds autocomplete suggestions to a toolbar above the keyboard, has secondary callouts for emoji skintones etc.
