## About

KeyboardKit Pro is a license-based extension to KeyboardKit that unlocks **{% include locales/count.html %}** locales and lets you create fully localized system keyboards with a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks localized services, local and remote autocomplete, emoji skintone support, more views etc. The Gold tier also lets you read all text content from the text document. 

Visit the [GitHub repo]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, online documentation, a demo application etc.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just tap the purchase buttons above or [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Features

### Customizable

Just like with the open-source library, the KeyboardKit Pro keyboards can be fully customized. You can change colors, fonts, icons etc., use custom views, insert additional keys anywhere etc.

KeyboardKit Pro also supports replacing any services with custom ones, and lets you subclass pro services to build custom things upon pro functionality.


### Additional views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional views that can be used to streamline the development process, such as additional toolbars, buttons, toggles etc.


### Emoji Skintones

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks emoji skintones for many emojis, which means that you will be able to long-press on an emoji in the emoji keyboard to get a callout with skintone variants.

Emoji skintone variants are automatically applied when you register a KeyboardKit Pro license. You don't have to make any changes to your code to activate skintones in your keyboard.


### Autocomplete

The local autocomplete engine uses on-device capabilities to provide suggestions. It doesn't work with all locales, so make sure to try the demo app to verify if it would work for your use case.

The remote autocomplete engine lets you connect to any external autocomplete API, and lets you customize your communication layer to great extent.


### Reading the full document content

The iOS text document proxy will not provide you with all text in the document, which means that it may be hard to build features like spell-checking, contextual support, AI assistance etc.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks additional proxy capabilities that make the text document proxy able to read the entire content of text document.
