You can hover the mouse pointer over each line in the grid for a more thorough description of what the title means.

Licenses can be purchased directly from the [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) e-shop<!--[Lemon Squeezy]({{site.lemon_url}})-->, or [over e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) if you require a custom setup or want to use your preferred method of payment or invoicing.


## License activation

You will receive a welcome email with a license agreement when your license has been activated, typically within 48h. The license period starts when the license is activated, not at the time of purchase.

If we are unable to activate your license within 48 hours after purchase, we will try to get in touch with you regarding the reason for the delay. You are free to refund your purchase at any time before your license has been activated.

If you have signed up for a Gold or Custom license, you are more than welcome to [schedule an onboarding call](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Onboarding%20Call), during which we can look at your needs and help you get started.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using KeyboardKit Pro. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Additional bundle IDs and test licenses can be added to a production license at a **50% discount** per ID and license. A test license can't be converted to a production license and must never be used in production builds.

By signing up for a license, you acknowledge and approve the information and terms listed on this page.


## Features

Some Pro features make use of special technologies that may stop working in any future platform updates. If a feature stops working due to changes in the platform, the feature may be removed without replacement or license adjustment.

Local autocomplete uses on-device technologies that may not be available to all locales. Make sure to evaulate it in the demo app for all the locales that you need, before you purchase a license.

Dictation is currently in BETA. It may need more adjustments before it performs well enough for production use. Since it requires some setup, the demo app doesn't contain a demo of this feature. Do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Dictation) for a live demo.


## Technical information

KeyboardKit Pro targets the current OS versions and two major versions back (one major version for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump and will be communicated in advance.

KeyboardKit Pro is built with the latest version of Xcode, but supports on-demand builds for the last major version up to three months after a new major version is released. After that, you must use the latest major version of Xcode.
