KeyboardKit Pro is a license-based extension to KeyboardKit that unlocks **{% include locales/count.html %}** locales and lets you create fully localized system keyboards with a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just tap the purchase buttons above or [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Features

Below are some clarifications to the license grid above. Visit [GitHub]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, online documentation, articles, a demo app etc.

### Fully customizable

Just like the open-source library, the KeyboardKit Pro keyboards can be fully customized. You can change colors, fonts, icons etc., use custom views, insert additional keys anywhere etc.


### Localized services

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks localized providers for input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions, for all the locales that your license includes.


### Additional views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional views that can be used to streamline the development process, such as additional toolbars, buttons, toggles etc.


### Emoji Skintones

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks emoji skintones support, which means that you will be able to long-press on an emoji in the emoji keyboard to get a callout with skintone variants.


### Local Autocomplete

The local autocomplete engine uses on-device capabilities to provide suggestions. It doesn't work with all locales, so make sure to try the demo app to verify if it would work for your use case.


### Remote Autocomplete

The remote autocomplete engine lets you connect to any external autocomplete API, and supports customizing request routes, headers etc.


### Reading the full document

The iOS text document proxy can't access the entire document by default, only the parts closest to the input cursor. KeyboardKit therefore extends it with capabilities to read the entire document.
