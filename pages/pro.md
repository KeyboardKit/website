## About

KeyboardKit Pro is a closed-source library that extends the [open source library](/open-source) with pro features like localized system keyboards, input sets, callout actions, local and remote autocomplete etc.

Check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo_pro}}) for more information about the library, the features it provides and how to use it in your app.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license that unlocks more features and locales. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses are currently purchased using your preferred method of payment (Bank Transfer, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit License) and we'll discuss your needs.


## License Information

Licenses are valid for **one app** (app plus keyboard extension). Additional apps can be added to a license at a 50% discount per additional app.

Gold licenses can be extended to support **tvOS** and **watchOS**, with support for **macOS** coming in 6.0. Additional platforms can be added to a license at a 50% discount per platform.

Licenses are valid for **one year**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during your license's validity period.

Expired licenses don't affect shipped apps. Apps will continue to function after the license expires. You will however need to renew your license to ship new app versions.

Licenses will renew at the price that was in effect when the license was purchased. This means that licenses are not affected by future price adjustments.


## Features

### Locale-specific features

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks locale-specific features, including localized system keyboards, input sets and callout actions.

This means that with KeyboardKit Pro, you can create a complete system keyboard in any locale that your license includes, with a single line of code.


### Local autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a local autocomplete engine that provides basic autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

The local autocomplete engine is currently not predictable and can not predict new words based on previously typed text.

Have a look at the demo app in the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_repo}}) to see the local autocomplete engine in action.


## Remote autocomplete

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a remote autocomplete engine that lets you connect your keyboard to a remote web API or web service.

Remote autocomplete makes it possible to provide powerful suggestions and predictions, and makes it possible to adjust and improve the autocomplete capabilities without having to ship new versions of the app. 

However, remote autocomplete requires full access and an Internet connection, so it may be a good idea to combine local and remote autocomplete when possible.


## Additional Views

KeyboardKit Pro adds a bunch of additional views. Check the documentation for more information.
