## About

KeyboardKit Pro is a license-based extension to KeyboardKit that unlocks {% include locales/count.html %} locales and lets you create fully localized system keyboards with a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks local and remote autocomplete, emoji skintone support, additional views etc. The Gold tier also lets you read all text content from the text document. 

Visit the [GitHub repo]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, online documentation, a demo application etc.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from [Gumroad]({{site.gumroad_url}}) or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just tap the purchase buttons above or [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Features

### Custom design

Just like with the open-source library, the KeyboardKit Pro keyboards can be fully customized. You can use custom appearances to change colors, fonts, shadows icons etc., use custom views for any key, insert additional keys anywhere etc.


### Additional views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional views that can be used to streamline the development process, such as additional toolbars and buttons.


### Emoji Skintones

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks emoji skintones for many emojis, which means that you will be able to long-press on an emoji in the emoji keyboard to get a callout with skintone variants.

Emoji skintone variants are automatically applied when you register a KeyboardKit Pro license. You don't have to make any changes to your code to activate skintones in your keyboard.


### Autocomplete

The local autocomplete engine uses on-device capabilities to provide suggestions. It doesn't work with all locales, so make sure to try the demo app to verify if it would work for your use case.

The remote autocomplete engine lets you connect to any external autocomplete API, and lets you customize your communication layer to great extent.


### Full proxy content

The iOS text document proxy will not provide you with all text in the document, which means that it may be hard to build features like spell-checking, contextual support, AI assistance etc.

To fix this, KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional proxy capabilities that makes the standard iOS text document proxy capable of reading the entire text document.
