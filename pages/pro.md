Just tap any of the purchase buttons above or [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.


## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend your license to keep using KeyboardKit Pro.


## Features

Visit [GitHub]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for a full list of features, sample code, online documentation, articles, a demo app etc.

Note that local autocomplete uses on-device capabilities that may not be available for some of the locales, and that the provided suggestions are not predictable nor as advanced as the native ones. You can evaulate it for all locales in the demo app, to see if it meets your needs.
