## About

KeyboardKit Pro extends KeyboardKit with up to 60 locales (including localized input sets, keyboard layouts and secondary callout actions), local and remote autocomplete, emoji skintones, being able to read the full document proxy content, additional views etc.

KeyboardKit Pro lets you create fully localized system keyboards with a single line of code and can elevate your keyboard with Pro features. Check out the [GitHub repository]({{site.github_url_pro}}) for more information.


## Licenses

KeyboardKit Pro requires a commercial license to be used. There are three tiers to choose from:

{% include grids/licenses.html %}

Licenses can be purchased from Gumroad or with your preferred payment method (Paypal, Xoom, etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License) and we'll discuss your needs.

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you can continue to use all versions that were released during the licenseâ€™s validity period.


## Autocomplete

Local autocomplete uses on-device capabilities to provide suggestions as the user types. It doesn't work with all locales, so make sure to try the demo app to verify if it would work for your use case.


## Demo app

If you want to try KeyboardKit Pro before you sign up for a Pro license, there is a demo app in both the [main]({{site.github_url}}) and the [Pro]({{site.github_url_pro}}) repositories, that shows you how to set up KeyboardKit Pro.

The KeyboardKit Pro demo lets you try out all localized keyboards, adds autocomplete suggestions to a toolbar above the keyboard, has secondary callouts for emoji skintones etc.
