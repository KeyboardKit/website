---


## Locales

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{%- include locales/count.html -%}</b> keyboard locales, with more being added over time:

{%- include locales/list.html -%}

KeyboardKit adds locale-specific information and localized strings for each locale. It lets you create localized keyboard features with little effort.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks fully localized system keyboards, input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions and lets you create a localized system keyboard with a single line of code.


## More features

KeyboardKit comes packed with features, like **keyboard actions**, **callouts**, **autocomplete**, **emojis**, **extensions**, **audio/haptic feedback**, **input set** and **keyboard layout** customization, **styling** etc.

KeyboardKit lets you create system keyboards that mimic the stock keyboards with a single line of code, which you can customize to great extent. You can also create completely custom keyboards as well, where you can use the library features in any way you like.
