### 🌐 Localization

KeyboardKit defines [{{site.locale_count}} keyboard-specific locales](/locales) that have localized content and assets that can be used to create completely localized system keyboards.


### 💥 Actions

KeyboardKit comes with a bunch of keyboard-specific action types, like inputs, system keys, actions etc. and standard ways to handle these actions. You can easily add your own logic to the mix.


### 🎨 Appearance

KeyboardKit comes with an appearance engine that lets you customize images, texts, colors, fonts, shadows, callouts, and more, for any part of the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks a [theme engine](/themes) that lets you style your keyboards with themes. You can create your own themes or use the standard set that come with the engine.


### 💡 Autocomplete

KeyboardKit can show autocomplete suggestions as the user types. [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks local and remote autocomplete providers that work with most keyboard locales.


### 🗯 Callouts

KeyboardKit can show an input callout when the user presses an input key and a secondary action callout when the user long presses an input key with secondary actions.


### 🎙️ Dictation

KeyboardKit has tools that let you perform [dictation](/dictation) from your custom keyboard extension, as well as in your app.


### 😊 Emojis

KeyboardKit defines emojis and emoji categories, as well as a lot of additional information about each emoji. It also has an emoji keyboard that mimics the native iOS emoji keyboard.


### ⌨️ External Keyboards

KeyboardKit lets you detect whether or not an external keyboard is used, so that you can hide or customize your software keyboard if needed.


### 👋 Feedback

KeyboardKit can give customizable haptic and audio feedback feedback as the user types or when certain actions are triggered.


### 👆 Gestures

KeyboardKit comes with a gesture engine that supports all native keyboard gestures, and that you can use to tailor the typing experience in your keyboards.

### 👁️ Preview Utilities

### ➡️ Proxy Extensions

KeyboardKit defines a bunch of extensions to the document proxy, that make it more powerful and capable than it is when you only have the native APIs.


### 🚏 Routing

KeyboardKit lets you route text to other destinations than the main app, for instance a text field within the keyboard extension itself.


### ⬅️ RTL

KeyboardKit supports both LTR (left-to-right) and RTL (right-to-left) locales, such as Arabic, Persian, Kurdish Sorani etc.


### ⚙️ System Settings
