KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{{site.locale_count}}</b> keyboard locales, with more being added over time:

{% include locales/list.html %}

[KeyboardKit](/open-source) provides locale-specific information (name, flag, unicode information, etc.) and localized strings for all keyboard locales.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) adds localized input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions for all locales in your license, which lets you create fully localized system keyboards.
