description: KeyboardKit supports 60 locales and lets you create keyboards with localized input keys, callouts, autocomplete etc.
---

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{% include locales/count.html %}</b> keyboard locales, with more being added over time:

{% include locales/list.html %}

KeyboardKit adds locale-specific information and localized strings for all locales and lets you create localized keyboards with little effort.

These locales are supported by many of the various [features](/features) that the library has to offer.
