description: KeyboardKit supports 75 locales
---

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{{site.locales.count}}</b> keyboard locales (languages), which determines things like keyboard layout, callout actions, autocomplete suggestions, etc.:

{% include locales/list.html %}

[KeyboardKit](/open-source) provides locale-specific information (name, flag, unicode information, etc.) as well as localized strings for all supported locales.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) adds localized keyboard layouts and callout actions for all locales in your license, which lets you create fully localized keyboards without any additional code.
