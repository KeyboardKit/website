## About

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{% include locales-count.html %}</b> locales, with more being added over time:

{% include locales.html %}

KeyboardKit adds locale information and localized strings for each locale, which means that you can create localized features with little effort.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks fully localized system keyboards, input sets, keyboard layouts and callout actions and lets you create a localized system keyboard with a single line of code.
