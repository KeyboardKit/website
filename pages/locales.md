description: KeyboardKit supports 75 locales
---

KeyboardKit comes with support for <b>{{site.locales.count}}</b> keyboard [locales](/features/localization) (languages), which determines things like keyboard layout, callout actions, autocomplete suggestions, etc.:

{% include locales/list.html %}

KeyboardKit defines locale-specific information (name, flag, unicode information, etc.) and localized strings for all supported locales.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks keyboard layouts and callout actions for all locales, to let you create fully localized keyboards with no additional code.
