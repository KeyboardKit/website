KeyboardKit keyboards can be customized to great extent. You can adjust input keys, layout, change how every individual key looks and behaves and much more.


## Appearance

KeyboardKit comes with an appearance engine that lets you change the button images and texts as well as the colors, fonts, shadows, callouts etc. for any part of the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) also unlocks a [theme engine](/themes) that makes it even easier to change the visual style of your keyboard. You can use the themes that come with the engine and create your own.


## Input Keys

KeyboardKit lets you customize the input keys of a keyboard. You can replace single keys or create a completely custom input set.


## Keyboard Layout

KeyboardKit lets you customize the entire layout of a keyboard. You can add and remove keys, move keys around and change the size of any individual key.


## Services

KeyboardKit uses services for everything, such as an action handler to handle key presses. All these services can be replaced by your own custom implementations.


## Views

KeyboardKit lets you use any custom views instead of the standard `SystemKeyboard`. You can add any custom views above and below it and even switch out the entire keyboard view.
