KeyboardKit keyboards can be customized to great extent. You can adjust input keys, layout, change how every individual key looks and behaves and much more.


## Styling

KeyboardKit comes with an styling engine that lets you change the button images and texts, as well as colors, fonts, shadows, callouts, etc. for any part of the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks a [theme engine](/features/themes) that makes it even easier to change the visual style of your keyboard. You can use the themes that come with the engine and create your own.


## Layout

KeyboardKit has input sets and keyboard layouts that let you customize the keys of a keyboard. You can replace, remove and insert single or multiple keys, or create a completely custom layout.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [localized input sets and keyboard layouts](/features/localization) for all the languages that your license includes. You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Callouts

KeyboardKit lets you customize the secondary callout actions that are presented when a user long presses a key that has secondary actions. You can show any actions you like in these callouts.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [localized callout actions](/features/localization) for all the languages that your license includes.  You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Services

KeyboardKit uses services for most behavior, such as an action handler that handles key presses. All these services can be replaced by your own custom implementations.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [pro services](/pro), such as local and remote autocomplete, an action handler that registers the most recent emojis, etc. You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Views

KeyboardKit lets you use custom views with the standard `SystemKeyboard`. You can add any custom views around it, replace any keys with custom views, and even switch out the entire keyboard view.
