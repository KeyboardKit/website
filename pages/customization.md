KeyboardKit can be customized to great extent. You can adjust input keys, keyboard layout, change how every individual key looks and behaves, and much more.


## Styling

KeyboardKit comes with a [styling engine](/features/styling) that lets you change the button images and texts, as well as colors, fonts, shadows, callouts, etc. for any part of the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks a [theme engine](/features/themes) that makes it even easier to style the keyboard. You can use the themes that come with the engine and create your own.


## Layout

KeyboardKit has a [layout engine](/features/layout) that lets you customize the keyboard layout. You can remove and insert single or multiple keys, or create a completely custom layout.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [localized keyboard layouts](/features/localization) for all languages in your license. You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Callouts

KeyboardKit lets you customize the [callouts](/features/callouts) that are shown when users type and long press a key that has secondary actions.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [localized callout actions](/features/localization) for all the languages in your license. You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Services

KeyboardKit has services for most behavior, like an [action handler](/features/action), an [autocomplete service](/features/autocomplete), etc. All services can be replaced by your own custom implementations.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks [pro services](/pro), such as local and remote autocomplete, an action handler that registers the most recent emojis, etc. You can use them as they are, or customize them further.


## Views

KeyboardKit lets you use custom views with the standard [system keyboard](/features/essentials-keyboardview). You can add any views in and around it, replace any keys with custom views, and even switch out the entire keyboard view.
