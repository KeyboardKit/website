KeyboardKit-based keyboards can be customized to great extent. For instance, you can adjust input keys, keyboard layout and change how every individual key looks and behaves.


## Appearance

KeyboardKit comes with an appearance engine that lets you change the button images and texts as well as the colors, fonts, shadows, callouts etc. for any part of the keyboard.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) also unlocks a [theme engine](/themes) that makes it even easier to change the visual style of a keyboard. You can create your own themes or use the ones that come with the engine.


## Input Keys

KeyboardKit lets you customize the input keys of a keyboard. You can replace single keys or create a completely custom input set.


## Keyboard Layout

KeyboardKit lets you customize the entire layout of a keyboard. You can add and remove keys, move keys around and change the size of any individual key.


## Services

KeyboardKit uses services for everything, such as an `action handler` to handle key presses, an `input set provider` to get the input keys, a `keyboard layout provider` to get the full keyboard layout, and so on. All services can be replaced by your own custom implementations.


## Views

KeyboardKit lets you use any custom views instead of the standard `SystemKeyboard`. You can add any custom views above and below it and even switch out the entire keyboard view.
