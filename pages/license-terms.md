## License terms

Licenses are valid for **one year**, **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. After your license expires, you must extend it to keep using KeyboardKit Pro. Expirations do not affect already shipped apps.

Additional bundles and test licenses can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per ID/license. A test license can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production.

By signing up for a license, you acknowledge and approve of the following terms and conditions.


## Features

Some Pro features make use of special technologies that may stop working in any future platform updates. If a feature stops working due to changes in the platform, the feature may be removed without replacement or license adjustment.

Local autocomplete uses on-device technologies that may not be available to all locales. Make sure to evaulate it in the demo app for all the locales that you need, before you purchase a license.

Dictation is currently in BETA. It may need more adjustments before it performs well enough for production use. Since it requires some setup, the demo app doesn't contain a demo of this feature. Do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=Dictation) for a live demo.


## Technical information

KeyboardKit Pro targets the current OS versions and two major versions back (one major version for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump and will be communicated in advance.

KeyboardKit Pro is built with the latest version of Xcode, but supports on-demand builds for the last major version up to three months after a new major version is released. After that, you must use the latest major version of Xcode.


## Closed Source License Agreement

This software and any associated software, documentation and resources (hereby referred to as "the Software") must only be used with a valid license key and a prior mutual and written agreement between the licenser and the licensee.

The Software must only be used in the application(s) that are included in the license agreement and must not be distributed to or used by developers, teams, companies or other parties that are not covered by the license agreement.

Any attempts to bypass or work around these limitations or any other restrictions or security mechanisms in the Software, will be seen as an attempt to violate the license agreement and may render the licenser liable to compensate the licensee for any damages, loss of IP or any other economic losses caused by the infringement.
