[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) works offline, which means that your users don't need an Internet connection to use its features or for your Pro license to be validated.

The only KeyboardKit Pro features that do need an Internet connection are the ones that are based on communicating with an external API, for instance remote autocomplete or ChatGPT-based features.
