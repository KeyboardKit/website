[KeyboardKit Pro Gold](/pro) unlocks more emoji features to bring your emoji keyboard to the next level.

The pro features include emoji skintone support, which means that a user can long press any emoji that has multiple skintone variants, to get a secondary callout with these variants.

The pro features also include emoji version information, which includes information about when an emoji was introduced, which platform it's available on, etc. This makes it possible to hide unsupported emojis.

The pro emoji features are automatically used when you register your Gold license. You don't have to write any additional code for this to work.
