# Terms & Conditions

These terms & conditions apply to the {{page.product}} SDK. Last updated 2023-10-24.


## License Details

{{page.product}} licenses are valid for **one app** and **one keyboard extension**. You can add additional bundles to your license at a **50%** discount.



## License Activation

{{page.product}} licenses are valid immediately after purchase. Use the license key in your purchase confirmation to set up KeyboardKit Pro.



## License Expiration

{{page.product}} licenses automatically expire when you stop renewing your license subscription and the subscription ends. This will disable all Pro features and make the keyboard show an error dialog.



## Technical information

{{page.product}} targets the current OS version and the two previous major versions (one for macOS). Support for older OS versions will only be removed in a major version bump.

{{page.product}} targets the latest version of Xcode, but offers on-demand builds for the last major version, up to three months after the latest major version was released. 


## Feature Disclaimer

Some Product features use technologies that may stop working in any future hardware or OS (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, etc.) update.

Features that stop working due to such breaking changes may be removed without replacement or compensation, since any required hardware or OS capabilities may no longer be available.

Local autocomplete uses on-device technologies that may not be available to all locales. Make sure to evaluate the locales you need in the demo or [KeyboardKit app](/app) before purchasing a license.

Dictation is in BETA and may need more work before it can be used in production. Since it requires some setup, the demo app doesn't demo this feature. You can test dictation in the [KeyboardKit app](/app).


## Refunds

All new subscriptions include a free trial, during which you have unlimited access to all the features in your selected tier.

You can cancel the free trial at any time. It will automatically convert to the paid plan once it ends if you don't cancel it.

No refunds will approved after the free trial ends. You can cancel your subscription at any time, to stop it from renewing.


## Closed Source License Agreement

This license agreement applies to the {{page.product}} SDK (hereby referred to as "the Software").

The Software and any associated software, documentation and resources  must only be used with a valid license key and a prior written agreement between the licenser and the licensee.

The Software must only be used in application(s) that are included in the license agreement, and must not be distributed to, or used by, developers, teams, companies or other parties that are not covered by the license agreement.

Any attempts to bypass or work around these limitations or any other restrictions or security mechanisms in the Software, will be considered as an attempt to violate the license agreement and may terminate the license and render the licenser liable to compensate the licensee for any efforts, damages, loss of IP or any other economic losses caused by the infringement.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANT-ABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


## Laws and Regulations
