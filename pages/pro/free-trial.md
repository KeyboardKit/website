description: KeyboardKit Pro has a free trial
---

KeyboardKit Pro has a [7 day free trial]({{site.gumroad_url}}) with unlimited access to all the features in your selected tier. This lets you try out the features and see if they match your needs.


## License Expiration

The free trial stops working if you cancel it. This will affect shipped apps, which will no longer be able to use KeyboardKit Pro.


## License Validation

The free trial requires server validation. The result is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, but your product will perform regular server validations to ensure that the license is valid.

If your free trial converts to a yearly license, it will be added to a new KeyboardKit Pro version, after which our license will validate locally, without any server roundtrips.
