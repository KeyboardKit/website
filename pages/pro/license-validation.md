description: KeyboardKit Pro can validate licenses over the Internet or on-device 
---

## License Validation

All [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) subscription licenses, except Yearly Gold, are validated over the Internet. This means that the keyboard extension requires Full Access to perform network calls.

Yearly Gold Licenses, as well as Custom & Enterprise licenses, are compiled into the library, and are validated on-device, without the need for Full Access or network calls.


## License Files

Yearly Gold Licenses, as well as Custom & Enterprise licenses, include a license file that you can use to update your license without having to update KeyboardKit Pro version.


## License Caching

For all licenses that require network-based validation, KeyboardKit will cache successful validation to be able to handle temporary connectivity loss.
