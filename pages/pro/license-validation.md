## License Validation

All [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) licenses except Yearly Gold are validated over the Internet. This requires that keyboard extensions enable Full Access.


## On-Device License Validation

Yearly Gold licenses are compiled into the library after the free 7 day trial. They are then validated on-device, without the need for Full Access or network calls.


## License Caching

Successful license validations are cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, and will then work for a while, even if the device is offline.


## App Group Syncing

Future versions of KeyboardKit will allow App Group syncing, to let the main app validate a license that can then be used by the keyboard extension. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) if you need this feature.
