---

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) licenses are validated over the Internet, which requires keyboard extensions to use Full Access. The only exception is Gold licenses, which are validated on-device.


## Online License Validation

Basic, Silver and Monthly Gold licenses are validated over the Internet. This means that keyboard extensions must have Full Access enabled to be able to make network calls.

KeyboardKit Pro licenses are cached on device and will therefore work even if the device is offline.


## On-Device License Validation

Yearly Gold licenses are compiled into the library and validated on-device, without the need for Full Access and with more room for customizations.

Since a new KeyboardKit Pro version must be released to add a license to the library, a Yearly Gold license will use Internet-based validation until a new version is released.
