## License Validation

All [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) subscription licenses except Yearly Gold are validated over the network, which means that your keyboard extension needs Full Access to validate your license key.

### Offline validation

Yearly Gold, Business, and Enterprise licenses are validated on-device, without need for Full Access.


## License Files

Yearly Gold, Business, and Enterprise licenses are shipped as license files that automatically unlock KeyboardKit Pro for your app and keyboard.


## License Caching

KeyboardKit automatically cache successful validation to allow for any temporary connectivity loss.
