description: KeyboardKit Pro can validate licenses over the Internet or on-device 
---

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) licenses are validated over the Internet, which requires keyboard extensions to use Full Access. The only exception is Gold licenses, which are validated on-device.


## Online License Validation

Basic and monthly Silver & Gold licenses are validated over the Internet. This means that keyboard extensions must have Full Access enabled to be able to make network calls.

KeyboardKit Pro licenses are cached on device and will therefore work even if the device is offline.


## On-Device License Validation

Yearly Silver & Gold licenses are compiled into the library after the free 7 day trial, after which they are validated on-device, without the need for Full Access or network calls.
