## License Validation

All [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) licenses, except Enterprise and Yearly Gold, are validated over the Internet. This means that the keyboard extension requires Full Access to perform network calls.


## Offline Validation

Enterprise licenses are compiled into the binary upon activation, and Yearly Gold after the free 7 day trial. They are then validated offline, without the need for Full Access.


## License Caching

Successful license validations are cached on device to handle temporary connectivity loss. This means that the license will keep working even if the device temporarily goes offline.


## App Group Syncing

Future versions of KeyboardKit will allow App Group syncing, to let the main app validate a license that can then be used by the keyboard extension. [Reach out]({{site.email_url}}) if you need this feature.
