## License Validation

All [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) licenses, except Yearly Gold and Custom ones, are validated over the Internet. This means that the keyboard extension requires Full Access to perform network calls.


## Offline Validation

For the best customer experience, custom licenses and Yearly Gold licenses are compiled into the binary and validated on-device, without the need for Full Access and network calls.

Custom licenses are compiled into the binary immediately upon activation, and Yearly Gold licenses after the free 7 day trial.


## License Caching

For all license types that require network-based validation, KeyboardKit still provides ways to make the license validation as smooth as possible for your users.

For instance, a successful license validation is cached to handle temporary connectivity loss, which means that the license will work even if the device goes offline temporarily.
