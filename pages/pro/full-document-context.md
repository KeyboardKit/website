By default, the `UITextDocumentProxy` that you use to integrate with the document, only lets you access the text closest to the input cursor.

This can provide problems if your keyboard needs to analyze the full document content, e.g. when using AI to reply to an e-mail, provide spellchecking or proof reading etc.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks a set of tools that let you read the entire document content, instead of just the text closest to the input cursor. These are really easy to use, and fit right at home with the native proxy capabilities.
