KeyboardKit defines how to implement autocomplete in your custom keyboard extension, but doesn't include an autocomplete service implementation. 

You can implement your own autocomplete service, or [purchase a KeyboardKit Pro license](/pro) to get autocomplete and autocorrect working, without having to write a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro will automatically set up a local, on-device autocomplete service when you register your license. This autocomplete service works offline and supports most of the [{{site.locale_count}} supported locales](/locales).

Gold licenses also give you access to a remote autocomplete service, that lets you connect a keyboard to any external autocomplete APIs, such as ChatGPT.
