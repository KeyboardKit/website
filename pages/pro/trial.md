description: The KeyboardKit Pro trial lets you try all pro features before purchasing.
---

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) requires a commercial license, but you can test all the pro features with a free trial version before deciding to buy.

Just [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20Trial%20Version) with some information about your company and app to get information on how to get a trial version.


## Demo App

You can try most pro features without having to write a single line of code. The [GitHub project]({{site.github_url_pro}}) has a demo app that is pre-configured with a Gold license.


## App Store

You can also try most pro features by downloading the [KeyboardKit app]({{site.appstore_url}}) from the App Store. It's a bit dated, but will soon be updated with the latest and greatest technologies.
