[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has different support levels, that are based on the license tiers and your needs.


## GitHub Issues

Just like the open-source users, you can use [GitHub Issues]({{site.github_url}}/issues) to get help with any problems you may have. This connects you with the developer community and let you help eachother out.

GitHub Issues are also where the KeyboardKit product roadmap is partly managed. Future versions are created and added to issues as soon as they're planned.


## E-mail support

Basic and Silver license customers can reach out over e-mail at any time to get help with problems, ask questions, and discuss KeyboardKit in general and their apps in particular.


## Prioritized support

Gold license customers have prioritized support, which means that their needs will be considered and prioritized when planning bug fixes and future releases.


## Dedicated support

Custom license customers can customize the support level to any needs they may have. It's possible to add test and additional support packages to the license, schedule support activites, etc.
