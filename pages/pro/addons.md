[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-on services, that are either included in the higher tiers, or available as optional add-ons.


## Onboarding call

Gold and Custom license customers can choose to connect over an optional onboarding call, that lets us understand your needs and help you get started.

During this call, we can help setting up the license, discuss how to use the pro features to fit your needs, or anything you need to get started.


## Monthly call

Custom license customers can choose to include an optional monthly call, that lets us keep track of your problems, discuss any problems or questions that you run into, etc.

The monthly call is an advisory tool, during which we can also schedule other activities, plan paid support hours or anything you need to keep your project going...and growing.


## Monthly plan

Custom license customers can choose a monthly payment plan, instead of the default annual one. This plan comes at a higher price, but let's you spread out the license cost over the year.


## Multi-platform

Due to the way that it's distributed as a pre-built binary, KeyboardKit Pro is by default distributed with support for iOS only.

Custom license customers can however get a tailored build, that supports the platforms that you need to support.


## Additional bundles

KeyboardKit Pro licenses are valid for **one year, one app** and **one keyboard extension**. You can however add additional bundle IDs to your license, at a 50% discount per ID.


## Test licenses

If you are building additional test versions of your app, you can add a test license to a production license, at a 50% discount per test version.

Unlike additional bundle IDs, a test license includes the bundle IDs of both the main test app and its keyboard extension. 

A test licence can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production.
