[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-ons that are available to Gold licenses. Just [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License%20Add-Ons) to discuss customizations and add-ons to your license.


## Onboarding Call

Gold customers have the option to connect over an initial onboarding call, where we'll discuss your needs and help you get started.


## Monthly Call

Gold customers have the option to opt-in to a monthly call, where we can keep track of your project, discuss any problems or questions that you may have, etc.


## Additional Apps (Bundle IDs)

Additional apps can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per addition (includes both an app and keyboard keyboard).


## Binary Licenses

Binary licenses are built into the release and validated locally, with more room for customizations. They can also be configured to never expire for the versions in which they are active.


## Multi-platform

The standard KeyboardKit Pro build is iOS only. Until the build is multi-platform by default, you can reach out for a custom plan that includes these capabilities.
