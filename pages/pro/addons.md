[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-on services, that are either included in the higher tiers, or available as optional add-ons.


## Onboarding call

Gold customers have the option to connect over an onboarding call, where we'll discuss your needs and help you get started.


## Monthly call

Gold customers have the option to connect over a monthly call, where we can keep in touch and keep track of your project, discuss any problems or questions that you may have, etc.


## Monthly plan

Gold customers can choose a [monthly subscription]({{site.gumroad_url_gold_sub}}) instead of the default annual one. This plan let's you spread out your license cost over the year, at a slightly higher price.


## Multi-platform

KeyboardKit Pro is by default distributed with support for iOS only. Gold customers can however get a build that supports all available platforms.


## Additional bundles

KeyboardKit Pro licenses are valid for **one year, one app** and **one keyboard extension**. You can add additional bundle IDs to your license, at a **50% discount per bundle**.


## Development licenses

You can add additional development licenses to a production license, for an alternate build of your app and keyboard, at a **50% discount per test license**.

A development licence can not be converted to a production license and must never be used in production. Development licenses that are used in production, may be deactivated at any time.
