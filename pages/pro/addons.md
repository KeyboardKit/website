[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-ons that are only available to custom licenses. Just [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20Custom%20License) to discuss customizations and add-ons.


## Custom Billing

Custom license customers can choose any means of billing or invoicing, specify PO:s and other legal requirements, choose a custom billing cadence, etc.


## Custom License Terms

Custom license customers can customize the KeyboardKit Pro license terms to accomodate to any business or legal requirements.


## Additional Apps (Bundle IDs)

Additional apps can be added to a custom license at a **50% discount** per addition (includes both an app and a keyboard extension), or as specified by custom terms.


## Multi-platform Support

The standard KeyboardKit Pro build is iOS only, due to binary size considerations. Custom license customers can request tailored, multi-platform builds.
