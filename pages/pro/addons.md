[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-on services, that are either included in the higher tiers, or available as optional add-ons.


## Onboarding call

Gold customers have the option to connect over an initial onboarding call, where we'll discuss your needs and help you get started.


## Monthly call

Gold customers have the option to opt-in to a monthly call, where we can keep track of your project, discuss any problems or questions that you may have, etc.


## Additional bundles

Additional bundle IDs licenses can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per addition (includes both an app and keyboard keyboard). This applies to both production apps and internal test apps.


## Multi-platform

The standard KeyboardKit Pro build is iOS only. Until the build is multi-platform by default, you can reach out for a custom plan that includes these capabilities.
