[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) has many optional add-ons that are available to Gold licenses. Just [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=KeyboardKit%20Pro%20License%20Add-Ons) to discuss customizations and add-ons to your license.


## Binary Licenses

Yearly Gold licenses are compiled into the library and validated on-device, without the need for Full Access and with more room for customizations.


## Onboarding Call

Gold customers have the option to connect over an initial onboarding call, where we'll discuss your needs and help you get started.


## Monthly Call

Gold customers have the option to opt-in to a monthly call, where we can keep track of your project, discuss any problems or questions that you may have, etc.


## Additional Apps (Bundle IDs)

Additional apps can be added to a license at a **50% discount** per addition (includes both an app and a keyboard extension).


## Multi-platform

The KeyboardKit Pro build is iOS only by deafult, due to binary size considerations. You can reach out for a custom plan that includes tailored, multi-platform builds.
