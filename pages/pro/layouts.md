[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks keyboard layouts for all the [{{site.locale_count}} supported locales](/locales). This means that you can layout your keyboard in all the locales that your license includes, without writing a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks additional layouts, like QWERTZ, AZERTY and DVORAK. These layouts can be used by all locales that have the same keyboard layout as English.

To use an alternate keyboard layout, just replace the standard input set provider for any language after registering your license.
