[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks complete keyboard layouts for all [{{site.locale_count}} supported locales](/locales). This means that you can support all locales that your license includes, without writing a single line of code.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks a localized input sets for all locales. You get access to alphabetic input sets, like `.swedish`, `spanish`, `german` etc., as well as numeric and symbolic input sets for each locale as well. The input sets are used by the localized layouts, and can be used standalone as well.

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks additional input sets, like `.qwertz`, `.azerty` and `.dvorak`. These layouts can be used by all layouts that have the same layout as English.
