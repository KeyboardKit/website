[KeyboardKit](/open-source) and [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) works offline, which means that your users don't need an online connection to use its features or for Pro licenses to be validated.

The only features that do need an Internet connection are the ones that are based on communicating with an external API, for instance [remote autocomplete](/features/autocomplete) or ChatGPT-based features.
