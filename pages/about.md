KeyboardKit is an [open-source](/open-source) software library (SDK) that lets you build custom keyboards for iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS & visionOS, using native technologies like Swift & SwiftUI.


## What is a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard is a small app extension that you ship together with your main app. It can then replace the system keyboard in any other app, by using the üåê key whenever you type.

A keyboard extension is the only app type that can be used directly within other apps in iOS. It lets people access your app features in other apps, such as AI-based typing support, language tools, etc.


## Why use KeyboardKit?

Apple's native keyboard APIs are very limited, and basically only lets you define a custom view and interact with the currently selected text field in very (very!) limited ways.

KeyboardKit extends these APIs with a lot more [features](/features) and lets you create a fully customizable keyboard with just a few lines of code, using Swift & SwiftUI for a modern development experience.


## Why upgrade to KeyboardKit Pro?

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free. You have full access to the code, and anyone can contribute to make the keyboard engine better.

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a commercial add-on that unlocks [pro features](/pro#features) like autocomplete, AI-enabling features, an emoji keyboard, dictation, themes, as well as [{{site.locale_count}} languages](/locales).
