## Why build a custom keyboard?

iOS keyboard extensions is the only way in which your company or brand can interact with other apps. By providing an outstanding keyboard extenson, users can use your technology in any app.

Keyboard extensions can provide users with custom language tools, proof read and spellcheck documents, and even use AI to automatically reply to e-mails and text messages.

However, the capabilities go beyond just keyboard-related functionality. For instance, did you know that keyboard extensions can work as a bridge between apps and external hardware?

The possibilities are really limitless, so don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you are curious to discuss how a keyboard extension could help to bring your brand where few brands go.


## Why is KeyboardKit needed?

If you've ever tried to build a custom keyboard for iOS, you may have noticed that the native APIs that are provided by Apple are very limited and basically only lets you insert and delete text, move the text input cursor and get limited information about the document. 

This is where KeyboardKit comes in.

KeyboardKit extends the native APIs to provide you with a lot more functionality and information and to make it easier to read from and write to the text document, analyze texts etc. KeyboardKit adds powerful [utilities, locales and services](/features) to the mix, to let you create keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboard with a few lines of code.


## Why is KeyboardKit great?

KeyboardKit supercharges your keyboard extensions and is super quick to get started with. You can be up and running in mere minutes.

KeyboardKit keyboards are fully customizable. You can either just mimic the native iOS keyboard and add your own brand to it, adjust and tweak any part of the keyboard, switch out one or all services e.g. to use your own autocomplete...or create entirely custom keyboards and just use the underling technology with a completely custom set of SwiftUI views.

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free, which means that you have full access to the source code. You can use it in any way you like and contribute to make it better.

If you want to take your keyboard to the next level, [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a license-based extension that unlocks [{{site.locale_count}} locales](/locales) and a bunch of [pro features](/pro) like autocomplete.
