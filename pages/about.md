KeyboardKit is a Swift-based library that lets you build custom keyboards for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, using native technologies like SwiftUI and UIKit.


## Why is KeyboardKit needed?

If you've ever tried to build a custom keyboard for iOS, you may have noticed that the native APIs are very limited and basically only lets you insert and delete text, move the text input cursor and get limited information about the document and its content. 

This is where KeyboardKit comes in.


## What does Keyboard do?

Keyboard extends these native APIs to provide you with a lot more functionality than is natively available, for instance to easier read and affect the text document, analyze texts etc. 

KeyboardKit also adds [additional locales, services and utilities](/features) to the mix, to let you create localized and customizable keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboard with a few lines of code.


## Open-source

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free, which means that you have full access to the source code. You can use it in any way you like and contribute to make it better.


## KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a license-based extension that unlocks [{% include locales/count.html %} locales](/locales) and a bunch of [pro features](/pro) that take your keyboards to the next level.
