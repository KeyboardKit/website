KeyboardKit is an [open-source](/open-source) software library (SDK) that helps you build custom keyboards for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, using native technologies like Swift and SwiftUI.


## What is a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard, or keyboard extension as it's actually called, is a small application that you can ship together with your app.

After installing your app, users can activate your custom keyboard in System Settings and use that keyboard instead of the standard keyboard that comes with the system.


## Why build a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard is the only way for your app, technology or brand to be used with other apps on iPhone or iPad.

If you have great language tools, a superb autocomplete engine or just want to style or customize the keyboard or improve the typing experience, a custom keyboard is the way to go.


## Why is KeyboardKit needed?

When building a custom keyboard for iOS, the native APIs are very limited, and basically only lets you set up a custom view, send text to the main app, and move the text cursor.

KeyboardKit extends these APIs with a lot more [features](/features) and lets you create fully customizable keyboards with just a few lines of code.


## Why is KeyboardKit great?

KeyboardKit supercharges your custom keyboard and gets you up and running in a few minutes, with very little code required. 

KeyboardKit is free and [open-source](/open-source), which means that you have full access to the code and that anyone can contribute to make it better.


## Is KeyboardKit actually free?

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free to use, but you can of course sponsor the project if you like it and want to support its ongoing development.

There is also a license-based [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) extension that unlocks pro features, like support for {{site.locale_count}} locales, autocomplete, dictation, themes etc.
