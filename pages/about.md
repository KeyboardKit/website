## Why build a custom keyboard?

Having a custom keyboard is the only way for your company, brand or app to be used within other apps on iPhone or iPad.

Custom keyboards can provide users with custom tools, proof read and spellcheck documents, use AI to automatically reply to e-mails and messages...and so much more.


## Why is KeyboardKit needed?

If you've ever tried building a custom keyboard for iOS, you may have noticed that the native APIs are very limited and basically only lets you insert and delete text, move the text input cursor and get limited information about the document. 

KeyboardKit extends the native APIs with a lot more [functionality and information](/features) than what is otherwise available. It lets you create keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboards with just a few lines of code. These keyboards can be styled and customized to great extent to fit your needs. 


## Why is KeyboardKit great?

KeyboardKit supercharges your custom keyboard and is super quick to get started with. You can be up and running in minutes, with very little code.

KeyboardKit is fully [customizable](/customization). You can adjust any part of the standard keyboard, add your own style or use any of the built-in [themes](/themes),  replace standard [features](/features) with your own implementations, and even create fully custom keyboards with completely custom SwiftUI views.

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free, which means that you have full access to the source code. You can use it in any way you like and contribute to make it better.

If you want to take your keyboard to the next level, [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a license-based extension that unlocks [{{site.locale_count}} locales](/locales) and a bunch of [pro features](/pro) like autocomplete and themes.
