## About

KeyboardKit is a Swift-based library that lets you build custom keyboard extensions for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, using technologies like SwiftUI and UIKit.


## Why is it needed?

If you've ever tried to build a custom keyboard for iOS, you may have noticed that the native APIs are quite limited, and basically only lets you insert and delete text, move the text cursor around and get limited information about the current document.

Keyboard extends these native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality than is natively available. KeyboardKit extends existing types and adds brand new services and utilities to the mix, to let you create keyboards that mimic the iOS stock keyboard in a single line of code.


## What can it do?

KeyboardKit adds a bunch of extension to existing types, as well as brand new services and utilities to control things like autocomplete, input sets, keyboard layouts, haptic and audio feedback etc. 

KeyboardKit adds standard implementations of all services, but you can replace any service with custom ones and inherit the standard ones to build upon already implemented functionality.

KeyboardKit has a system keyboard that can be used to mimics the stock iOS keyboard, as well as a bunch of views that can be used together with existing services or completely standalone. 

KeyboardKit lets you customize the look, feel and behavior or the system keyboard and all other views. You can change things like the appearance (colors, icons, fonts), keys, keyboard layout etc.

KeyboardKit also provides you with a lot of utilities that don't have to be used in a keyboard, such as string utilities, word analysis, emoji information etc.


## Open-source

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free, which means that you have full access to the source code. You can use it in any way you like and contribute to make it better.


## KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a license-based extension to KeyboardKit. It unlocks {% include locales/count.html %} locales and a bunch of pro features and lets you create fully localized system keyboards with a single line of code.
