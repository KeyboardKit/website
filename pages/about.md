## Why build a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard is the only way for your app, product, technology or brand to be used together with other apps on iPhone or iPad. It lets you provide custom tools and behavior, spellcheck text, use AI to reply to e-mails and messages, and so much more. Your imagination is (almost) the limit.


## Why is KeyboardKit needed?

When building a custom keyboard for iOS, the native APIs are very limited and basically only lets us insert and delete text, move the input cursor and get very limited information about the active app. 
KeyboardKit extends the native APIs with a lot more [features](/features) than is otherwise available, and lets you create customizable keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboards with a few lines of code.


## Why is KeyboardKit great?

KeyboardKit supercharges your keyboard and is super quick to get started with. You can be up and running in minutes, with very little code. It is completely free and [open-source](/open-source), which means that you have full access to the code and that anyone can contribute to make it better.
If you want to take things to the next level, [KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) unlocks pro features like autocomplete, dictation, themes, emoji skintones and much more.
