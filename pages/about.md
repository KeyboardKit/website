KeyboardKit is an [open-source](/open-source) software library (SDK) that helps you build custom keyboards for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, using native technologies like Swift and SwiftUI.


## What is a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard is a small application that you ship together with your app. It can replace the standard system keyboard and can be used together with any other app.


## Why build a custom keyboard?

A custom keyboard is the only iOS app that can be used with other apps. It lets you provide users with your own language tools, AI-based typing support, or just a nice, custom look & feel.


## Why use KeyboardKit?

The native keyboard APIs are very limited, and basically only lets you set up a custom view, get and set text with the currently focused text field, and move the input cursor.

KeyboardKit extends the native APIs with a lot more [features](/features) and lets you create fully customizable keyboards that supports [{{site.locale_count}} locales](/features/locales) with just a few lines of code.


## Completely free

KeyboardKit is [open-source](/open-source) and completely free to use. You have full access to the source code to make tweaks you may need, and anyone can contribute to make it better.


## KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro](/pro) is a license-based add-on to the [open-source]({{site.github_url}}) SDK, that unlocks [pro features](/pro#features) like [{{site.locale_count}} languages](/locales), autocomplete & autocorrect, an emoji keyboard, dictation, themes, and much more.
